# Admissions

## Admissions Cycle

Most students begin our graduate programs in the fall, though spring and summer start dates are occasionally possible. Prospective students typically reach out to faculty during the summer or fall prior to applying. Early communication is strongly encouraged, as faculty must plan ahead to secure funding and mentorship capacity for new students.

Priority consideration is given to applications submitted by the [December deadlines](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/academics). A departmental admissions committee reviews applications in December and January. Initial offers are typically made beginning in mid-February.

Students have until **April 15** to formally accept or decline an offer. Between mid-February and April, additional offers may be made as applicants respond to initial offers and as funding availability becomes clearer.

## Prospective Students

We encourage prospective applicants to watch the webinar below, which provides an overview of graduate school and introduces our specific programs. The webinar also includes a Q&A with current graduate students.

### Contacting Prospective Advisors

#### Do I need to contact potential advisors before applying?

Yes. Applicants to M.S. or Ph.D. programs in the Department of Biological Sciences (Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior) must contact potential thesis advisors before submitting an application. Admission is contingent on identifying a faculty mentor who is able to support your graduate training.

A directory of faculty can be found on the [faculty webpage](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/people) and on individual program pages within the [department website](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/academics).

It is never too early to reach out to potential advisors. We recommend contacting faculty between August and October of the year prior to your intended start date. For example, contact potential advisors in September 2025 if you plan to apply by January 2026 for a Fall 2026 start. However, opportunities may arise throughout the year, so do not hesitate to reach out at any time.

#### How do I contact potential advisors?

After identifying faculty whose research aligns with your interests, send a concise introductory email that includes:

- A brief introduction and your current academic or professional status  
- A description of your research interests  
- A short explanation of why you are interested in that faculty member’s work  
- Attachments: CV or résumé and unofficial transcripts  

An optional email template is provided below to help you get started.

#### Can I contact more than one professor?

Yes. Graduate positions are competitive, and faculty may only take one or two students in a given year (if any). You are encouraged to contact multiple faculty members whose research aligns with your interests. You may mention in your email that you are also contacting other faculty within the department or university.

#### What if I don’t receive a response?

Faculty receive many emails and may have limited availability. If you do not receive a reply after one week, it is appropriate to send a polite follow-up. If you do not receive a response after two or three attempts, the faculty member is likely not accepting new students at that time.

### Application Process and Funding

#### Are application fee waivers available?

Some applicants may be eligible for a fee waiver after identifying a prospective advisor who is open to supporting their application. Prospective students should discuss this with potential advisors.

#### I have a prospective advisor who encouraged me to apply. What next?

Visit the webpage for your intended program for detailed application instructions, including required materials, deadlines, and submission procedures.

#### What funding is available?

In most cases, we admit students only when funding is available to support them financially throughout their degree. Support typically includes:

- Tuition and health insurance coverage  
- A stipend through teaching or research assistantships  

Funding commonly comes from a combination of:

- Teaching assistantships in undergraduate biology laboratories  
- Faculty research grants  
- University fellowships (limited and often awarded to current students)  
- External fellowships or government sponsorships (for some domestic and international students)  

To receive full consideration for assistantships, applicants should apply by the January deadline. Prospective students should discuss funding directly with potential advisors. Some faculty maintain lists of external fellowship opportunities that may also be helpful.

#### What are the requirements of each program?

Program requirements (such as coursework and milestones) vary. Please review the individual program pages for detailed information.

### General Advice for Applying to Graduate School

- Reflect on your goals and motivations for pursuing graduate study and research  
- Clearly communicate your interests and career goals when contacting potential advisors  
- Familiarize yourself with faculty research through publications, websites, and other resources  
- Seek feedback on your CV or résumé from mentors, advisors, or career centers  
- Highlight research experience, relevant coursework, technical skills, and awards  

## Email Template for Contacting Faculty

The template below is provided as a starting point for reaching out to potential advisors. Applicants should tailor each email to the individual faculty member and their research program.

Dear Dr. [Professor’s Last Name],
