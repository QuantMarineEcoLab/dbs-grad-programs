# M.S. Marine Biology

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

Students in the M.S. Marine Biology program develop a plan of study in consultation with their advisor and Master’s Thesis Committee. The program includes required core courses and competencies, thesis research, and professional development.

Completion of at least **30 credits** is required, including research credits. Students develop a thesis proposal within the first year and complete thesis research (typically 6–10 credits). The degree is awarded when:

- Thesis research results are deemed acceptable  
- A formal public thesis presentation and defense has occurred  
- The thesis is approved by the Thesis Committee and accepted by the Graduate School  

All students are expected to present research publicly (including at the UNH Graduate Research Conference) and to gain teaching and/or mentoring experience.

Up to **8 graduate credits** may be transferred from another institution if:
- They were not counted toward another degree  
- A grade of B or higher was earned  
- The transfer is approved by the advisor, committee, and Graduate School

## Program Requirements and Timeline

### Thesis Committee

The thesis committee typically consists of three members:
- The advisor (chair)  
- One additional DBS faculty member  
- One member external to the department  

Students should work with their advisor to form a committee early in the program.

## Thesis Proposal

### Purpose

The thesis proposal defines the research problem, methods, and expected contributions. Approval of the proposal represents agreement between the student and program regarding the scope of an acceptable thesis.

Students are expected to work closely with their advisor and committee when preparing the proposal.

### Format

- Maximum length: **20 double-spaced pages** (excluding references and appendices)

- Pages must be numbered  
- Appendices and references should be numbered separately (Roman numerals)  

Proposals exceeding the page limit will not be accepted.

### Required Sections

Proposals must include the following sections:

1. **Title of the Study**  
2. **Statement of the Problem**  
   - Clear description of research question and scope  
   - Objectives and/or hypotheses  

3. **Justification and Significance**  
   - Rationale for the study  
   - Relationship to existing literature  
   - Importance to the field and to the student  

4. **Methodology or Procedures**  
   May include research design, study system, sampling, data collection, and analytical methods.

5. **Broader Impacts**  
   - Intellectual merit  
   - Contribution to knowledge  
   - Relevance to scientific and broader communities  

6. **Literature Cited**

7. **Appendices (optional)**  
   May include extended methods, preliminary data, or compliance approvals (e.g., IACUC/IRB).

### Timing

- Typically submitted before or during the first semester of thesis research credits  
- Must be submitted **at least one semester** before thesis defense  
- Submit electronically with required approval form and signatures to the Program Coordinator  

### Revised Proposals

If significant changes in topic or methodology occur, a revised proposal may be required. Students should consult their advisor and Program Coordinator.

## Annual Progress Review

Each spring, students participate in an annual progress review with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee.

**Goals of the review:**
- Encourage reflection on progress and goals  
- Support timely degree completion  
- Provide mentorship and feedback  
- Document progress and address concerns  

**Preparation includes:**
- Student progress report submitted to advisor and committee  
- Advisor evaluation and summary of committee meeting  
- Teaching feedback (if applicable)

Failure to complete required progress review materials may result in a registration hold.

## Enrollment and Registration

Graduate students must maintain continuous enrollment in fall and spring through coursework, research registration, or continuing enrollment.

**Full-time status:**
- 9+ credits, or  
- Master’s research (GRAD 900), or  
- Holding an assistantship (minimum 6 credits or GRAD 900)

Students registered for continuing enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible for assistantships.

Students should consult their advisor regarding appropriate course load based on research, teaching, and field obligations.
