# Ph.D. Neuroscience & Behavior

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

The Ph.D. in Neuroscience & Behavior prepares students to become independent researchers and leaders in academic, clinical, and industry settings. Students develop advanced expertise in neuroscience and behavior while conducting original dissertation research.

Students work closely with their advisor and Doctoral Guidance Committee to develop a program of study that includes required coursework, competencies, and a dissertation research plan. Following successful completion of the qualifying examination, students advance to doctoral candidacy and establish a Dissertation Committee to oversee completion of the dissertation.

The Ph.D. is awarded upon completion of required coursework, advancement to candidacy, successful dissertation research and defense, and approval of the dissertation by the committee and Graduate School.

Students typically complete **30–35 credits** of coursework and research.

## Doctoral Guidance and Dissertation Committees

Students have two sequential committees.

### Doctoral Guidance Committee

Established as early as possible and no later than the end of the **first year**.

Composition:
- Advisor (chair)  
- At least three additional faculty  
- Representation from at least two relevant departments (e.g., Biological Sciences, MCBS, Psychology, Communication Sciences & Disorders)

Committee members, other than the advisor, should not be directly involved in the proposed research. Students submit the Guidance Committee Nomination Form to the Graduate School.

Responsibilities:

- Evaluate proposal feasibility and originality  
- Oversee the qualifying examination  

### Dissertation Committee

Established upon advancement to candidacy.

Composition:
- At least five members  
- No more than three from any one NSB department  
- At least two members external to the primary department or institution  

Students are encouraged to include external members beyond UNH to broaden professional networks. The Dissertation Committee supervises dissertation research, administers the final defense, and determines degree completion.

## Qualifying Examination and Advancement to Candidacy

### Timeline

The qualifying examination and advancement to candidacy typically occur in **Year 3** and no later than **Year 4**.

### Purpose

The qualifying exam evaluates:
- Depth and breadth of knowledge in neuroscience and behavior  
- Ability to develop and defend a rigorous research proposal  
- Scientific writing and communication skills  

### Written Component

The written qualifying exam is a research proposal, typically modeled after an **NIH NRSA F31** fellowship or similar format.

Typical components include:
- Specific aims  
- Background and significance  
- Innovation  
- Research approach and methods  
- Timeline and milestones  

The proposal must be submitted to the Guidance Committee at least **three weeks** before the oral exam. Majority approval is required to proceed.

Students are encouraged, though not required, to submit proposals for external fellowships (e.g., NIH).

### Oral Component

The oral exam follows successful completion of the written proposal and typically includes:
- Presentation of research proposal  
- Questions on proposal and broader field knowledge  

Possible outcomes:
- Pass  
- Conditional Pass  
- No Pass  

Students receiving a Conditional Pass must address identified weaknesses. Students receiving a No Pass may retake the exam within six months. Failure to pass after a second attempt may result in recommendation to transition to the M.S. program.

### Advancement to Candidacy

Upon passing the qualifying examination, students are formally advanced to Ph.D. candidacy and the Dissertation Committee is appointed.

UNH requires advancement to candidacy within **five years** of enrollment.
