# Program Overview

Welcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.

We offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior. 

We prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect. 

Ongoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall. 

Below you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.

As a department, we voted to adopt the [Healthy Research Teams & Labs framework](https://cgsnet.org/resources/toolkits/healthy-labs-and-research-teams) where we agree to the following seven principles.

1. Setting clear expectations for advising and mentorship and engaging in practices that help foster positive, productive, and fulfilling relationships. We recognize the importance of supportive advisory relationships in facilitating personal, academic, and professional development of research team members.  
2. Creating an environment where the welfare of all research team members is prioritized. We recognize that our research team’s best work is more likely to be achieved when members feel welcome, supported, and encouraged to strive toward professional and personal goals.  
3. Explicitly stating our commitment to fair practices. We recognize that clearly stating our commitment helps to ensure graduate students are given fair attention and opportunities.  
4. Encouraging collaboration rather than competition within our research teams and labs. We understand the important role that a collaborative and supportive environment has in fostering success and well-being of research team members.  
5. Engaging in continual learning to refine skills in research leadership and management. We recognize the importance of elevating our advising and mentorship, research management, and leadership skills through ongoing professional development.  
6. Promoting professional development opportunities for a variety of career paths. We understand graduate students have diverse career aspirations and we play a significant role in encouraging them to engage in a variety of professional development activities.  
7. Encouraging students to be curious, innovative, and open in their work. We understand that research integrity and rigor can be achieved when students are encouraged to be curious, collaborative, and open throughout the research process.

## Graduate School Deadlines

Some Graduate School deadlines are firm and must be adhered to regardless of individual progress. Students are responsible for being aware of these deadlines.

See the [Graduate School Academic Calendar](https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/graduate-school-academic-calendar) for current dates and requirements.

## Graduate School Involvement

The Graduate School provides opportunities and information related to the Graduate Student Senate (GSS), professional development workshops, the Graduate Research Conference, and additional funding programs.

The Graduate School sends a **weekly email** highlighting upcoming programs, events, opportunities, and deadlines relevant to graduate students. Students are strongly encouraged to read this email regularly.

## Graduate Program Coordination and Admissions Committee (GPC)

The Graduate Program Coordination and Admissions Committee (GPC), chaired by the Graduate Coordinator, oversees the standards and implementation of the graduate program. Membership consists of the Associate Chair, the program coordinators for each graduate program, and one additional faculty member from each option.

The GPC is responsible for establishing universal guidelines for all graduate students in each degree (M.S. and Ph.D.) and for bringing forward suggestions for changes in program policies. The committee welcomes input and suggestions from graduate students, faculty, and staff.

The GPC also oversees annual **Progress Reviews** for graduate students in the program (see Chapter 3). Graduate students are encouraged to approach the Graduate Coordinator or another committee member for advice at any time; however, the student’s faculty advisor and committee ordinarily serve as the primary point of contact.
