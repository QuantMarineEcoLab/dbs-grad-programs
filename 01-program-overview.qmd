# Program Overview

Welcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.

We offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior. 

We prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect. 

Ongoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall. 

Below you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.

As a department, we voted to adopt the [Healthy Research Teams & Labs framework](https://cgsnet.org/resources/toolkits/healthy-labs-and-research-teams) where we agree to the following seven principles.

1. Setting clear expectations for advising and mentorship and engaging in practices that help foster positive, productive, and fulfilling relationships. We recognize the importance of supportive advisory relationships in facilitating personal, academic, and professional development of research team members.  
2. Creating an environment where the welfare of all research team members is prioritized. We recognize that our research team’s best work is more likely to be achieved when members feel welcome, supported, and encouraged to strive toward professional and personal goals.  
3. Explicitly stating our commitment to fair practices. We recognize that clearly stating our commitment helps to ensure graduate students are given fair attention and opportunities.  
4. Encouraging collaboration rather than competition within our research teams and labs. We understand the important role that a collaborative and supportive environment has in fostering success and well-being of research team members.  
5. Engaging in continual learning to refine skills in research leadership and management. We recognize the importance of elevating our advising and mentorship, research management, and leadership skills through ongoing professional development.  
6. Promoting professional development opportunities for a variety of career paths. We understand graduate students have diverse career aspirations and we play a significant role in encouraging them to engage in a variety of professional development activities.  
7. Encouraging students to be curious, innovative, and open in their work. We understand that research integrity and rigor can be achieved when students are encouraged to be curious, collaborative, and open throughout the research process.

#Summary of Shared Requirements
M.S. Degree:
o	30 credit hours total, with 10 maximum being research credit
o	Thesis proposal, OKed by thesis committee
o	Public presentation and thesis defense with committee


Ph.D. Degree:
o	Variable credit hours dependent on program, and guidance committee recommendations
o	Thesis proposal, OKed by thesis committee
o	Written and oral comprehensive exams
o	Public presentation and dissertation defense with committee


The M.S. degree should normally be completed in two years. The University requires that all graduate work for any master's degree must be completed within six years from the date of enrollment in the program. 

The Ph.D. degree should normally be completed within five years (three years for students entering with a master’s degree). All graduate work for the Ph.D. must be completed within eight years of enrollment, or within seven years if the student entered with a master's degree in the same field. Per University policy, the student must be advanced to candidacy within five years after enrollment or within four years if the student entered with a master's in the same field. In DBS, we encourage students to advance to candidacy in the second or third year. 
Students and research projects do not all progress at the same pace. The timelines are offered as a guide, but departure from them is permissible when circumstances warrant. There are, however, some firm Graduate School deadlines that must be adhered to: see https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/graduate-school-academic-calendar  for details.
