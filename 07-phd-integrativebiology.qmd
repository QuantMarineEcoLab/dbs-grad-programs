# Ph.D. Integrative Biology

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

Ph.D. students in Integrative Biology work with their advisor and Doctoral Guidance Committee to develop a program of study that includes required core courses, competency requirements, and a viable dissertation research program.

The **Doctoral Guidance Committee** is normally established by the end of the **first semester** and should meet by the end of the **second semester**. The student presents a preliminary research proposal to the committee demonstrating the **soundness, originality, and feasibility** of the planned research. The Guidance Committee approves the proposal and oversees the qualifying examination through which the student advances to doctoral candidacy. The **Doctoral Dissertation Committee** is established at the time of advancement to candidacy.

To earn the Ph.D. degree, students must:

- Complete an original dissertation that contributes new knowledge  
- Present dissertation results in a public seminar  
- Pass an oral dissertation defense with the Dissertation Committee  
- Have the dissertation approved by the committee and accepted by the Graduate School  

All students are expected to present research publicly (including at the UNH Graduate Research Conference) and to gain teaching and/or mentoring experience.

## Credit Requirements

There is no specific minimum credit requirement for the Ph.D.; however, students must complete required core courses, meet competency requirements, and satisfy all program milestones.

Up to **8 graduate credits** may be transferred from another institution if:
- The credits were not counted toward another degree  
- A grade of B or higher was earned  
- The transfer is approved by the advisor, committee, and Graduate School

## Required Courses and Competencies

All Ph.D. Integrative Biology students must complete the following:

**Core Course**
- **BIOL 901 – Introductory Graduate Seminar**  
  A first-semester course focused on key information and skills for a successful transition into graduate study, including program expectations and cohort building.

**Experimental Design and Analysis (2 courses)**
- Two courses in experimental design and analysis  
- May be fulfilled by prior approved graduate coursework or by completing two graduate-level courses  

**Writing and Communication (1 course)**
- May be fulfilled by prior graduate coursework (if approved) or by completing a graduate-level course  
- Recommended courses often include:  
  - BIOL 902 – Writing and Publishing Science (typically fall)  
  - BIOL 950 – Scientific Communication (typically spring)

**Ethics Requirement**
Students may fulfill the ethics requirement by either:
- Completing the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training workshop, or  
- Completing a graduate-level ethics course

**Electives**
Students work with their advisor and committee to select additional coursework aligned with their research focus and career objectives.

## Program Requirements and Timeline

### Committee Structure

Ph.D. committees consist of **five members**:
- The advisor (chair)  
- One additional DBS faculty member  
- Three additional members, **at least two of whom must be external to DBS**

Additional requirements:
- UNH committee members must be part of the Graduate Faculty (or obtain Graduate Faculty status)  
- For non-UNH members, a CV must be submitted  
- All members should hold a Ph.D. or have commensurate experience

## Enrollment, Registration, and Credit Policies

Graduate students must maintain continuous enrollment in fall and spring through coursework, research registration, or continuing enrollment.

**Full-time status:**
- 9+ credits, or  
- Doctoral Research (BIOL 999), or  
- Holding an assistantship (minimum 6 credits or BIOL 999)

Students registered for continuing enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible for assistantships.

Students should consult their advisor regarding appropriate course load in light of research, teaching, and field obligations.

### Course and Credit Policies

**Graduate Courses**
- 800- and 900-level courses count toward degree requirements  
- Must be taken for a letter grade (if graded option available)

**700-Level Courses**
- Up to 12 credits may count toward graduate degree (by petition)  
- Must be outside the student’s program  
- Must include additional graduate-level requirements  

**Undergraduate Courses (<700 level)**
- May be taken if necessary for background preparation  
- Do not count toward graduate degree credits  

**Audited Courses**
- Allowed with advisor and instructor approval  
- Count toward enrollment requirements but not degree credits  

**Transfer Credit**
- Up to 8 credits may be transferred (B or higher; not counted toward another degree)  
- Transfer request form: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies  

### Tuition, Fees, and Financial Support

Students on assistantships (TA or RA) typically receive tuition support and pay reduced mandatory fees. Mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student.

Doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy may petition each semester to waive fees if they meet specified conditions.

## Change of Degree Status (M.S. to Ph.D.)

M.S. graduates typically pursue employment or further study elsewhere after completing the thesis. In some cases, an M.S. student may petition to continue into the Ph.D., either after completing the M.S. or (rarely) by converting before completing the M.S.

Key points:
- Admission to the Ph.D. is **not automatic** upon completion of the M.S.  
- Conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment occurs only in **extraordinary circumstances**  
- Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the **third semester** of enrollment  
- The advisor convenes the DBS Graduate Program Committee and the student’s M.S. committee to review the request  
- If supported, a change-of-degree form is submitted for Graduate School approval: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies  

Students who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) must complete **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)** training:

## Research Proposal, Qualifying Exam, and Advancement to Candidacy

### Research Proposal

Ph.D. students present and defend a formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee as part of advancement to candidacy, typically in the **second or third year**.

Expectations:
- A solid proposal draft shared with the committee by the end of the **second semester**  
- Presentation of the proposal in seminar form to the committee, and preferably to a broader audience  

Students should consult program leadership for guidance on proposal length and format.

### Qualifying Examination

Following proposal approval, students must pass a qualifying examination assessing:
- Broad foundational knowledge of the field  
- Knowledge central to the dissertation research  

Structure:
- **Written exam:** typically completed by the end of the **fifth semester**  
- **Oral exam:** follows successful completion of the written exam, usually within a few weeks  

Students are responsible for scheduling both components well in advance.

Upon passing both parts:
- The advisor submits the form to advance the student to candidacy: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies  
- The Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formally nominated using the Graduate School form

## Annual Progress Review

Each spring, students participate in an annual progress review with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee.

**Goals of the review:**
- Encourage reflection on progress and goals  
- Support timely degree completion  
- Provide mentorship and feedback  
- Maintain clear documentation of progress  

**Preparation includes:**
- Student progress report submitted to advisor and committee  
- Advisor evaluation and summary of committee meeting  
- Teaching feedback (if applicable)

All materials are submitted to the designated departmental staff member, who schedules the review meeting (typically mid-April through mid-May). Failure to complete the review process may result in a registration hold.
