# M.S. Integrative Biology

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

Students in the M.S. Integrative Biology program develop a plan of study in consultation with their advisor and Master’s Thesis Committee. The program includes required core courses and competencies, thesis research, and professional development.

Completion of at least **30 credits** is required, including research credits. Students develop a thesis proposal within the first year and complete thesis research (typically 6–10 credits). The degree is awarded when:

- Thesis research results are deemed acceptable  
- A formal public thesis presentation and defense has occurred  
- The thesis is approved by the Thesis Committee and accepted by the Graduate School  

All students are expected to present research publicly (including at the UNH Graduate Research Conference) and to gain teaching and/or mentoring experience.

## Research Proposal

M.S. students must have their thesis proposal approved by their advisor and Thesis Committee by the end of the **second semester**.

## Annual Progress Review

Each spring, students participate in an annual progress review with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee.

**Goals of the review:**
- Encourage reflection on progress and goals  
- Support timely degree completion  
- Provide mentorship and feedback  
- Document progress and address concerns  

**Preparation includes:**
- Student progress report submitted to advisor and committee  
- Advisor evaluation and summary of committee meeting  
- Teaching feedback (if applicable)

All materials are submitted to the designated departmental staff member, who schedules the review meeting (typically mid-April through mid-May). Summary feedback is shared with the student, advisor, and Program Coordinator. Failure to complete the process may result in a registration hold.
