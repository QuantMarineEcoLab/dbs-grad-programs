# Ph.D. Marine Biology

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

Ph.D. students work with their advisor and Doctoral Guidance Committee to develop a plan of study that includes required core courses, competency requirements, and a viable dissertation research program.

The **Doctoral Guidance Committee** is typically established by the end of the **first semester** and should meet by the end of the **second semester**. The student presents a preliminary research proposal to the committee that demonstrates the **soundness, originality, and feasibility** of the planned research. The Guidance Committee is responsible for approving the proposal and overseeing the qualifying examination through which the student advances to doctoral candidacy. The **Doctoral Dissertation Committee** is established at the time of advancement to candidacy.

To earn the Ph.D. degree, students must:

- Complete an original dissertation that contributes new knowledge  
- Present dissertation results in a public seminar  
- Pass an oral dissertation defense (private examination) with the Dissertation Committee  
- Have the dissertation approved by the Dissertation Committee and accepted by the Graduate School  

All students are expected to present research publicly (including at the UNH Graduate Research Conference) and to gain teaching and/or mentoring experience.

## Credit Requirements

There is no specific minimum credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must complete required core courses and meet competency and milestone requirements.

Up to **8 graduate credits** may be transferred from another institution if:
- They were not counted toward another degree  
- A grade of B or higher was earned  
- The transfer is approved by the advisor, committee, and Graduate School

## Required Courses and Competencies

All Ph.D. Marine Biology students must complete the following:

1. **BIOL 901 – Introductory Graduate Seminar**  
   A first-semester course focusing on key information and skills for a successful transition into graduate study, including program expectations and cohort building.

2. **Contemporary Techniques (2 courses)**  
   - Two courses in contemporary research techniques  
   - At least **one must be quantitative**  
   - Course selection should be determined with the advisor or Graduate Program Coordinator  

3. **Writing and Communication (1 course)**  
   - May be fulfilled by prior graduate coursework (if approved) or by completing a graduate-level course  
   - Recommended courses often include:  
     - BIOL 902 – Writing and Publishing Science  
     - BIOL 950 – Scientific Communication  

4. **Marine-Focused Course (1 course)**  
   - May be fulfilled by prior approved graduate coursework or by completing a marine-focused graduate course  

5. **Field Experience Requirement**  
   - May be fulfilled through a graduate course with a substantial field component, or  
   - Field research conducted in support of dissertation research  

6. **Teaching Experience Requirement**  
   - Ph.D. students must serve as a Teaching Assistant for **one semester**, or demonstrate equivalent prior teaching experience.

## Program Requirements and Timeline

### Committee Structure

Ph.D. committees typically include **five members**:
- The advisor (chair)  
- One additional DBS faculty member  
- Three additional members, **at least two of whom must be external to DBS**

Additional requirements:
- UNH committee members must be part of the Graduate Faculty (or obtain Graduate Faculty status)  
- For non-UNH members, a CV must be submitted  
- All members should hold a Ph.D. or have commensurate experience

---

## Enrollment and Registration

Graduate students must maintain continuous enrollment in fall and spring through coursework, research registration, or continuing enrollment.

**Full-time status:**
- 9+ credits, or  
- Doctoral Research (BIOL 999), or  
- Holding an assistantship (minimum 6 credits or BIOL 999)

Students registered for continuing enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible for assistantships.

Students should consult their advisor regarding appropriate course load in light of research, teaching, and field obligations.

## Course and Credit Policies

**Graduate Courses**
- 800- and 900-level courses count toward degree requirements  
- Must be taken for a letter grade (if graded option available)

**700-Level Courses**
- Up to 12 credits may count toward graduate degree (by petition)  
- Must be outside the student’s program  
- Must include additional graduate-level requirements  

**Undergraduate Courses (<700 level)**
- May be taken if necessary for background preparation  
- Do not count toward graduate degree credits  

**Audited Courses**
- Allowed with advisor and instructor approval  
- Count toward enrollment requirements but not degree credits  

**Transfer Credit**
- Up to 8 credits may be transferred (B or higher; not counted toward another degree)  
- Transfer request form: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies

## Change of Degree Status (M.S. to Ph.D.)

M.S. graduates typically pursue employment or further study elsewhere after completing the thesis. In some cases, an M.S. student may petition to continue into the Ph.D., either after completing the M.S. or (rarely) by converting before completing the M.S.

Key points:
- Ph.D. admission is **not automatic** upon completion of the M.S.  
- Conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment occurs only in **extraordinary circumstances**  
- If appropriate, conversion should occur no later than the beginning of the **third semester** of enrollment  
- The advisor will convene the DBS Graduate Program Committee and the student’s M.S. committee to consider the request  
- If supported, a change-of-degree form is submitted for Graduate School approval: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies  

Students who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) must complete **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)** training: https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh

## Research Proposal, Qualifying Exam, and Advancement to Candidacy

### Research Proposal

Ph.D. students present and defend a formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee as part of advancement to candidacy, typically in the **second or third year**.

Expectations:
- A solid proposal draft should be shared with the committee by the end of the **second semester**  
- The proposal should be presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably to a broader audience  
- Students should consult program leadership for proposal length and format expectations  

### Qualifying Examination

After the proposal is approved, students must pass a qualifying examination assessing:
- Broad foundational knowledge in the field  
- Knowledge central to the dissertation project  

Structure:
- **Written exam:** typically no later than the end of the **fifth semester** (may be delayed if necessary)  
- **Oral exam:** follows successful completion of the written exam, usually within a few weeks  

Students are responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam and should plan well in advance.

After passing both parts:
- The advisor submits the required Graduate School form to advance the student to candidacy: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies  
- The Doctoral Dissertation Committee is nominated using the Graduate School form: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies

## Annual Progress Review

Each spring, students participate in an annual progress review with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee.

**Goals of the review:**
- Encourage reflection on progress and goals  
- Support timely degree completion  
- Provide mentorship and feedback  
- Document progress and address concerns  

**Preparation includes:**
- Student progress report submitted to advisor and committee  
- Advisor evaluation and summary of committee meeting  
- Teaching feedback (if applicable)

All materials are submitted to the designated departmental staff member, who schedules the review meeting (typically mid-April through mid-May). Summary feedback is shared with the student, advisor, and Program Coordinator. Failure to complete the process may result in a registration hold.
