    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This handbook provides an overview and practical details of requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS). There are currently six graduate programs that exist within the department: MS and PhD options for Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, Neuroscience & Behavior. While each program has specific curricular requirements, there remains much overlap between the two programs. Thus, this will serve as a general guide for being a graduate student in DBS with notes for each program as needed. Both programs, like all other graduate programs at UNH, are part of the UNH Graduate School; additional details, links, and resources for graduate students are available at the UNH Graduate School website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the department. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document (see Edit this page to the right. As a department member, you should have push access and not need to fork the repo). If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or send an email (DBS.GradPrograms@unh.edu).\n\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

    "text": "2.1 Summary of Shared Requirements\nWelcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.\nWe offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior.\nWe prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect.\nOngoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall.\nBelow you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.\nEaston R. White, Ph.D.\nChair, Graduate Program Committee\nAs a department, we voted to adopt the Healthy Research Teams & Labs framework where we agree to the following seven principles.",

A departmental admissions committee reviews applications in December and January. Initial offers are typically made beginning in mid-February.\nStudents have until April 15 to formally accept or decline an offer. Between mid-February and April, additional offers may be made as applicants respond to initial offers and as funding availability becomes clearer.",

    "text": "3.2 Prospective Students\nWe encourage prospective applicants to watch the webinar below, which provides an overview of graduate school and introduces our specific programs. The webinar also includes a Q&A with current graduate students.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Contacting Prospective Advisors\n\n3.2.1.1 Do I need to contact potential advisors before applying?\nYes. Applicants to M.S. or Ph.D. programs in the Department of Biological Sciences (Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior) must contact potential thesis advisors before submitting an application. Admission is contingent on identifying a faculty mentor who is able to support your graduate training.\nA directory of faculty can be found on the faculty webpage and on individual program pages within the department website.\nIt is never too early to reach out to potential advisors. We recommend contacting faculty between August and October of the year prior to your intended start date. For example, contact potential advisors in September 2025 if you plan to apply by January 2026 for a Fall 2026 start. However, opportunities may arise throughout the year, so do not hesitate to reach out at any time.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 How do I contact potential advisors?\nAfter identifying faculty whose research aligns with your interests, send a concise introductory email that includes:\n\nA brief introduction and your current academic or professional status\n\nA description of your research interests\n\nA short explanation of why you are interested in that faculty member’s work\n\nAttachments: CV or résumé and unofficial transcripts\n\nAn optional email template is provided below to help you get started.\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Can I contact more than one professor?\nYes. Graduate positions are competitive, and faculty may only take one or two students in a given year (if any). You are encouraged to contact multiple faculty members whose research aligns with your interests. You may mention in your email that you are also contacting other faculty within the department or university.\n\n\n3.2.1.4 What if I don’t receive a response?\nFaculty receive many emails and may have limited availability. If you do not receive a reply after one week, it is appropriate to send a polite follow-up. If you do not receive a response after two or three attempts, the faculty member is likely not accepting new students at that time.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Application Process and Funding\n\n3.2.2.1 Are application fee waivers available?\nSome applicants may be eligible for a fee waiver after identifying a prospective advisor who is open to supporting their application. Prospective students should discuss this with potential advisors.\n\n\n3.2.2.2 I have a prospective advisor who encouraged me to apply. What next?\nVisit the webpage for your intended program for detailed application instructions, including required materials, deadlines, and submission procedures.\n\n\n3.2.2.3 What funding is available?\nIn most cases, we admit students only when funding is available to support them financially throughout their degree. Support typically includes:\n\nTuition and health insurance coverage\n\nA stipend through teaching or research assistantships\n\nFunding commonly comes from a combination of:\n\nTeaching assistantships in undergraduate biology laboratories\n\nFaculty research grants\n\nUniversity fellowships (limited and often awarded to current students)\n\nExternal fellowships or government sponsorships (for some domestic and international students)\n\nTo receive full consideration for assistantships, applicants should apply by the January deadline. Prospective students should discuss funding directly with potential advisors. Some faculty maintain lists of external fellowship opportunities that may also be helpful.\n\n\n3.2.2.4 What are the requirements of each program?\nProgram requirements (such as coursework and milestones) vary. Please review the individual program pages for detailed information.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 General Advice for Applying to Graduate School\n\nReflect on your goals and motivations for pursuing graduate study and research\n\nClearly communicate your interests and career goals when contacting potential advisors\n\nFamiliarize yourself with faculty research through publications, websites, and other resources\n\nSeek feedback on your CV or résumé from mentors, advisors, or career centers\n\nHighlight research experience, relevant coursework, technical skills, and awards",

There are several types of assistantships: Teaching Assistants (TAs) run labs and do grading and other tasks for undergraduate classes; Research Assistantships (RAs) support students working on a faculty member’s project (20 hours/week); and students may be supported as Project Assistants (PAs) on their advisors’ external grants. Offer letters would also specify summer funding.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for independent fellowship support, as well as for funding to pay for research expenses, travel, etc. Obtaining independent funding is professionally as well as financially useful. See “useful links” below for some ideas about how to get started.",

    "text": "13.1.1 Program policies and expectations\nSubject to satisfactory progress by the student, the Biological Sciences Graduate Program provides financial support up to the limit stated in the admission letter: normally two years (four semesters) of academic-year support for the M.S. degree and four years (eight semesters) of academic-year support for the Ph.D. A student who completes an M.S. and then continues as a Ph.D. candidate, or who converts from M.S. to Ph.D. enrollment, may anticipate a total of four years of support from the program.\nAdditional support may be available based on a clear need arising from the nature of the research (e.g. field projects that require two summers of data), and evidence of strong progress toward completion. A decision to request additional support must be made by the start of the final semester of guaranteed support. Where there is a compelling reason for an extension, the student’s advisor must present a written request for one additional semester of support from the program, explaining why the student needs more time to complete the degree. The Admissions Committee and Chair will review and decide on such requests. Approval is not automatic: students and advisors should not assume that extended support will be available if the degree is not completed on time.\nSince one purpose of limiting the duration of support is to encourage students to complete their degrees on schedule, students initially supported in other ways who later receive a Teaching or Research/Project Assistantship may not be entitled to the full duration of support stated above. All students will be advised of the extent of support they may expect at the time of admission.\nTeaching or Research/Project Assistantship appointments (see Chapter 5) are normally for the academic year, but can be terminated at the end of a semester if performance is unsatisfactory. With satisfactory performance in both research and teaching, the student, once appointed to an assistantship, can expect to be reappointed in subsequent years up to the limit specified upon admission.\nStudents who obtain their own funding (e.g. through a competitive fellowship, or part-time students working for state or federal agencies) are not penalized by a reduction of support from the program: they are still entitled to the full number of semesters stated in their admission letter.\n\n\n13.1.2 Support for graduate student travel and research expenses\nThe program has some funds available to support student travel. The student needs to submit a formal request to the Chair, detailing what meeting they are planning on attending, when and where the meeting will take place, whether they are presenting a poster or giving a talk, and a solid estimate of costs for meals, housing, etc. The Program will help pay for travel only if a student presents a poster or gives a talk – not if they are just attending the meeting. In the past, travel grants have been for up to $250. Students can request this once in a single fiscal year.\nThe Graduate School offers travel grants for graduate students who are presenting papers and posters at professional meetings and conferences. They generally do not support travel to workshops, seminars, and conferences where students are not presenting, but will consider such requests where the nature of the program is directly related to the student’s research agenda at UNH. Travel grants are also available to students who are attending professional development workshops and seminars that will enhance their research agendas. Travel grants will not exceed $200 per student per conference, or $400 per student per year. https://www.gradschool.unh.edu/php/travel_grant.php\nSee “Useful links” below for more possibilities.\n\n\n13.1.3 UNH Graduate School fellowships\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for the UNH Graduate School’s Summer TA Fellowship (provides partial support for one summer) and Dissertation Year Fellowship (provides support for the final year of Ph.D. work). Detailed information is available at http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/pdf/frm_aid.php .\nPre-application for Summer TA Fellowships. Summer TA Fellowships are allocated mainly on the basis of merit, but there is also consideration given to distributing them across programs – in fact, the Graduate School requires each program to rank their students who are applying, before applications are submitted. The likelihood of lots of students from the same program receiving awards is extremely low; rather, programs are most successful when they put forward a short list of their strongest applicants. To enable students and letter-writers to focus their time and energy where it will be most likely to pay off, the Biological Sciences Program has instituted a pre-application procedure. The Awards and Scholarship Committee is responsible for pre-applications and ranking, and will publicize the procedure to be followed, including a due date for pre-application materials. Note that students who do not follow this procedure will automatically be ranked at the bottom of the list of applicants from the program.",

    "text": "14.1 UNH Graduate School Graduate Assistant handbook\nThe GA Handbook provides detailed information on registration requirements, policies, workload, and other critical topics related to assistantships. The handbook is regularly revised and updated; please contact the Graduate School or search their website for a current version.\nEssential policies are stated in the Graduate Catalog: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/\nTeaching Assistantships, Research Assistantships, and Project Assistantships cover a stipend, health insurance, and the technology fee. Students are responsible for other mandatory fees.\n\n14.1.1 Teaching Assistantships\nAn opportunity to teach is an important part of every graduate student’s education. Most students in the program receive support as Teaching Assistants during at least part of their enrollment. Students not offered a teaching assistantship at the commencement of their enrollment are considered whenever positions become available, but presence in the program is not a guarantee of support.\nTeaching Assistants are half-time employees (20 hrs/week), with considerable responsibilities to their students and to the department/program. Teaching Assistantships are awarded by the Department Chair in consultation with the GPC. The process is complicated: it involves balancing teaching needs, student expertise, and fair allocation of resources.\nA Teaching Assistant’s performance is evaluated by the students in the course, who complete a formal course evaluation at the end of the semester. The results are available for the Teaching Assistant and the course supervisor. In addition, the instructor in whose course you serve as a TA should provide written evaluation and feedback at the end of the semester: this information is important for your annual progress review as well as for applications for Summer TA Fellowships (see Chapter 4).\nPoor performance as a Teaching Assistant may jeopardize continued funding.\n\n\n14.1.2 Research and Project Assistantships\nResearch/Project Assistantships may be available on specific research projects supported by external grants or contracts. Responsibility for filling a Research or Project Assistantship rests with the faculty member who administers the grant, with the proviso that any RA/PA appointed must be acceptable for admission as a graduate student. Tuition waivers are usually available for Research Assistants. The duration of support on an Assistantship is determined by the faculty member administering the grant. A student who makes insufficient progress or whose academic performance is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the program even though RA support remains available.\nIt is critical that the RA/PA and the project supervisor communicate clearly about expectations and responsibilities. Students owe the project that pays them 20 hours per week, as a condition of their appointment; but if it overlaps their own research (as is often the case), they may well be working on it much more than that.",
