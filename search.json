    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This handbook provides an overview and practical details of requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS). There are currently six graduate programs that exist within the department: MS and PhD options for Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, Neuroscience & Behavior. While each program has specific curricular requirements, there remains much overlap between the two programs. Thus, this will serve as a general guide for being a graduate student in DBS with notes for each program as needed. Both programs, like all other graduate programs at UNH, are part of the UNH Graduate School; additional details, links, and resources for graduate students are available at the UNH Graduate School website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the department. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document (see Edit this page to the right. As a department member, you should have push access and not need to fork the repo). If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or send an email (DBS.GradPrograms@unh.edu).\n\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

    "text": "2.1 Summary of Shared Requirements\nWelcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.\nWe offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior.\nWe prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect.\nOngoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall.\nBelow you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.\nEaston R. White, Ph.D.\nChair, Graduate Program Committee\nAs a department, we voted to adopt the Healthy Research Teams & Labs framework where we agree to the following seven principles.",

A departmental admissions committee reviews applications in December and January. Initial offers are typically made beginning in mid-February.\nStudents have until April 15 to formally accept or decline an offer. Between mid-February and April, additional offers may be made as applicants respond to initial offers and as funding availability becomes clearer.",

    "text": "3.2 Prospective Students\nWe encourage prospective applicants to watch the webinar below, which provides an overview of graduate school and introduces our specific programs. The webinar also includes a Q&A with current graduate students.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Contacting Prospective Advisors\n\n3.2.1.1 Do I need to contact potential advisors before applying?\nYes. Applicants to M.S. or Ph.D. programs in the Department of Biological Sciences (Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior) must contact potential thesis advisors before submitting an application. Admission is contingent on identifying a faculty mentor who is able to support your graduate training.\nA directory of faculty can be found on the faculty webpage and on individual program pages within the department website.\nIt is never too early to reach out to potential advisors. We recommend contacting faculty between August and October of the year prior to your intended start date. For example, contact potential advisors in September 2025 if you plan to apply by January 2026 for a Fall 2026 start. However, opportunities may arise throughout the year, so do not hesitate to reach out at any time.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 How do I contact potential advisors?\nAfter identifying faculty whose research aligns with your interests, send a concise introductory email that includes:\n\nA brief introduction and your current academic or professional status\n\nA description of your research interests\n\nA short explanation of why you are interested in that faculty member’s work\n\nAttachments: CV or résumé and unofficial transcripts\n\nAn optional email template is provided below to help you get started.\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Can I contact more than one professor?\nYes. Graduate positions are competitive, and faculty may only take one or two students in a given year (if any). You are encouraged to contact multiple faculty members whose research aligns with your interests. You may mention in your email that you are also contacting other faculty within the department or university.\n\n\n3.2.1.4 What if I don’t receive a response?\nFaculty receive many emails and may have limited availability. If you do not receive a reply after one week, it is appropriate to send a polite follow-up. If you do not receive a response after two or three attempts, the faculty member is likely not accepting new students at that time.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Application Process and Funding\n\n3.2.2.1 Are application fee waivers available?\nSome applicants may be eligible for a fee waiver after identifying a prospective advisor who is open to supporting their application. Prospective students should discuss this with potential advisors.\n\n\n3.2.2.2 I have a prospective advisor who encouraged me to apply. What next?\nVisit the webpage for your intended program for detailed application instructions, including required materials, deadlines, and submission procedures.\n\n\n3.2.2.3 What funding is available?\nIn most cases, we admit students only when funding is available to support them financially throughout their degree. Support typically includes:\n\nTuition and health insurance coverage\n\nA stipend through teaching or research assistantships\n\nFunding commonly comes from a combination of:\n\nTeaching assistantships in undergraduate biology laboratories\n\nFaculty research grants\n\nUniversity fellowships (limited and often awarded to current students)\n\nExternal fellowships or government sponsorships (for some domestic and international students)\n\nTo receive full consideration for assistantships, applicants should apply by the January deadline. Prospective students should discuss funding directly with potential advisors. Some faculty maintain lists of external fellowship opportunities that may also be helpful.\n\n\n3.2.2.4 What are the requirements of each program?\nProgram requirements (such as coursework and milestones) vary. Please review the individual program pages for detailed information.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 General Advice for Applying to Graduate School\n\nReflect on your goals and motivations for pursuing graduate study and research\n\nClearly communicate your interests and career goals when contacting potential advisors\n\nFamiliarize yourself with faculty research through publications, websites, and other resources\n\nSeek feedback on your CV or résumé from mentors, advisors, or career centers\n\nHighlight research experience, relevant coursework, technical skills, and awards",

    "section": "6.3 Program Requirements and Timeline",
    "text": "6.3 Program Requirements and Timeline\n\n6.3.1 Committee\nCommittees are comprised of five people: your advisor, another DBS faculty member, and three additional people. At least two committee members must be external to DBS. Members of UNH must be part of the graduate faculty (which is an easy application if they aren’t already graduate faculty). For non-UNH members, you must submit a CV on their behalf. All committee members should have a PhD or commensurate experience.\n\n\n6.3.2 Credit Requirements\nThe M.S. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits, 6-¬10 of which are earned for thesis research (BIOL 899 Master’s Thesis ).\nThere is no specific credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must meet curriculum requirements.\nUp to 8 graduate credits from another institution may be transferred, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the course grade was a B or higher. Petitions requesting transfer credit must be supported by the advisor and graduate committee, and approved by the UNH Graduate School. Students admitted via the Accelerated Master’s (AM) process may apply up to 12 credits of prior upper-level UNH coursework in accordance with AM policies.\nThe level of the courses taken to meet registration requirements is not specified. However, taking non-graduate classes does not move one towards degree completion, so taking undergraduate classes is not a common practice. A grad student cannot petition to take a 500-level course, however 500-level courses can be audited by graduate students with the cost of the course at the expense of the graduate student.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor and committee which courses will be most useful, and what course load makes sense in light of specific research and assistantship obligations (for example, an intense field season).\nHow many credits to take, and financial implications:\nGraduate students are normally required to maintain continuous enrollment each Fall and Spring semester by registering for courses, research (Grad 900/BIOL 999), or continuing enrollment (Grad 800) (see below for distinctions). Students who don’t register for the Fall and Spring semesters will have their degree status discontinued.\nGraduate students registered for 9 or more credits, Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900), or Doctoral Research (999) are classified as full-time students. Students holding assistantship appointments are also considered full time and must register for a minimum of 6 credits, or Doctoral Research (999) each semester. Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nDoctoral students who have advanced to candidacy may petition each semester to waive fees if they meet the specified conditions (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B. The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n6.3.3 Change of Degree Status, M.S. to Ph.D. Enrollment\nM.S. graduates normally go elsewhere for further study or for employment after completing their thesis. However, students enrolled for an M.S. degree may petition the Graduate School to continue for the Ph.D. after receipt of the M.S. or, rarely, to convert to Ph.D. enrollment without first completing the M.S. If a student wishes to convert from M.S. to Ph.D., the advisor will convene a meeting of the DBS GPC and the student’s Master’s Thesis Committee to consider the application. If the application has departmental support, a “change of degree” form is then completed and submitted for Graduate School approval (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nAdmission to Ph.D. enrollment should not be considered automatic on completion of the M.S., and conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment is done only in extraordinary circumstances. Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the third semester of enrollment.\nStudents who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Further information is available at https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh.\n\n\n6.3.4 Research Proposal\nPh.D. students present and defend their formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee in order to be advanced to candidacy, normally in the second or third year. However, a solid draft of the proposal should be shared with the committee by the end of the second semester, and presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably for a wider (public) audience.\nPlease contact individual Program Coordinators to find guidance in terms of proposal length and format.\nPh.D. qualifying exam and advancement to candidacy\nFollowing approval of the research proposal by their committee, students who wish to be admitted to doctoral candidacy must pass a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the project. The student is responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam; plan well ahead to account for committee members’ travel plans, sabbaticals, etc. The written portion of the qualifying exam should be taken no later than the end of the fifth semester, though it may be delayed beyond that point if necessary. The oral portion of the exam follows successful completion of the written part, usually within a few weeks.\nStudent’s should contact their respective degree programs to be provided specific details regarding the procedure of both the written and oral comprehensive exam.\nWhen the student has passed both parts of the qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program by submitting the appropriate form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) . At this point, the student’s Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be nominated using the Graduate School form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) .\n\n\n6.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n6.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n6.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n6.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates. It can be found at https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/ See Graduate School Catalog for general information, policies, and student rights: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/",

If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n7.3.4 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n7.3.5 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n7.3.6 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates.

    "section": "8.3 Program Requirements and Timeline",
    "text": "8.3 Program Requirements and Timeline\n\n8.3.1 Committee\nCommittees are comprised of five people: your advisor, another DBS faculty member, and three additional people. At least two committee members must be external to DBS. Members of UNH must be part of the graduate faculty (which is an easy application if they aren’t already graduate faculty). For non-UNH members, you must submit a CV on their behalf. All committee members should have a PhD or commensurate experience.\n\n\n8.3.2 Credit Requirements\nThe M.S. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits, 6-¬10 of which are earned for thesis research (BIOL 899 Master’s Thesis ).\nThere is no specific credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must meet curriculum requirements.\nUp to 8 graduate credits from another institution may be transferred, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the course grade was a B or higher. Petitions requesting transfer credit must be supported by the advisor and graduate committee, and approved by the UNH Graduate School. Students admitted via the Accelerated Master’s (AM) process may apply up to 12 credits of prior upper-level UNH coursework in accordance with AM policies.\nThe level of the courses taken to meet registration requirements is not specified. However, taking non-graduate classes does not move one towards degree completion, so taking undergraduate classes is not a common practice. A grad student cannot petition to take a 500-level course, however 500-level courses can be audited by graduate students with the cost of the course at the expense of the graduate student.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor and committee which courses will be most useful, and what course load makes sense in light of specific research and assistantship obligations (for example, an intense field season).\nHow many credits to take, and financial implications:\nGraduate students are normally required to maintain continuous enrollment each Fall and Spring semester by registering for courses, research (Grad 900/BIOL 999), or continuing enrollment (Grad 800) (see below for distinctions). Students who don’t register for the Fall and Spring semesters will have their degree status discontinued.\nGraduate students registered for 9 or more credits, Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900), or Doctoral Research (999) are classified as full-time students. Students holding assistantship appointments are also considered full time and must register for a minimum of 6 credits, or Doctoral Research (999) each semester. Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nDoctoral students who have advanced to candidacy may petition each semester to waive fees if they meet the specified conditions (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B. The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n8.3.3 Change of Degree Status, M.S. to Ph.D. Enrollment\nM.S. graduates normally go elsewhere for further study or for employment after completing their thesis. However, students enrolled for an M.S. degree may petition the Graduate School to continue for the Ph.D. after receipt of the M.S. or, rarely, to convert to Ph.D. enrollment without first completing the M.S. If a student wishes to convert from M.S. to Ph.D., the advisor will convene a meeting of the DBS GPC and the student’s Master’s Thesis Committee to consider the application. If the application has departmental support, a “change of degree” form is then completed and submitted for Graduate School approval (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nAdmission to Ph.D. enrollment should not be considered automatic on completion of the M.S., and conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment is done only in extraordinary circumstances. Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the third semester of enrollment.\nStudents who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Further information is available at https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh.\n\n\n8.3.4 Research Proposal\nPh.D. students present and defend their formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee in order to be advanced to candidacy, normally in the second or third year. However, a solid draft of the proposal should be shared with the committee by the end of the second semester, and presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably for a wider (public) audience.\nPlease contact individual Program Coordinators to find guidance in terms of proposal length and format.\nPh.D. qualifying exam and advancement to candidacy\nFollowing approval of the research proposal by their committee, students who wish to be admitted to doctoral candidacy must pass a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the project. The student is responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam; plan well ahead to account for committee members’ travel plans, sabbaticals, etc. The written portion of the qualifying exam should be taken no later than the end of the fifth semester, though it may be delayed beyond that point if necessary. The oral portion of the exam follows successful completion of the written part, usually within a few weeks.\nStudent’s should contact their respective degree programs to be provided specific details regarding the procedure of both the written and oral comprehensive exam.\nWhen the student has passed both parts of the qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program by submitting the appropriate form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) . At this point, the student’s Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be nominated using the Graduate School form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) .\n\n\n8.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n8.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n8.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n8.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates.

Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nDoctoral students who have advanced to candidacy may petition each semester to waive fees if they meet the specified conditions (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B. The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n10.3.3 Change of Degree Status, M.S. to Ph.D. Enrollment\nM.S. graduates normally go elsewhere for further study or for employment after completing their thesis. However, students enrolled for an M.S. degree may petition the Graduate School to continue for the Ph.D. after receipt of the M.S. or, rarely, to convert to Ph.D. enrollment without first completing the M.S. If a student wishes to convert from M.S. to Ph.D., the advisor will convene a meeting of the DBS GPC and the student’s Master’s Thesis Committee to consider the application. If the application has departmental support, a “change of degree” form is then completed and submitted for Graduate School approval (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nAdmission to Ph.D. enrollment should not be considered automatic on completion of the M.S., and conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment is done only in extraordinary circumstances. Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the third semester of enrollment.\nStudents who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Further information is available at https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh.\n\n\n10.3.4 Research Proposal\nPh.D. students present and defend their formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee in order to be advanced to candidacy, normally in the second or third year. However, a solid draft of the proposal should be shared with the committee by the end of the second semester, and presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably for a wider (public) audience.\nPlease contact individual Program Coordinators to find guidance in terms of proposal length and format.\nPh.D. qualifying exam and advancement to candidacy\nFollowing approval of the research proposal by their committee, students who wish to be admitted to doctoral candidacy must pass a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the project. The student is responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam; plan well ahead to account for committee members’ travel plans, sabbaticals, etc. The written portion of the qualifying exam should be taken no later than the end of the fifth semester, though it may be delayed beyond that point if necessary. The oral portion of the exam follows successful completion of the written part, usually within a few weeks.\nStudent’s should contact their respective degree programs to be provided specific details regarding the procedure of both the written and oral comprehensive exam.\nWhen the student has passed both parts of the qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program by submitting the appropriate form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) . At this point, the student’s Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be nominated using the Graduate School form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) .\n\n\n10.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n10.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n10.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n10.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates. It can be found at https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/ See Graduate School Catalog for general information, policies, and student rights: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/",

    "text": "11.1 General information\nGraduate students in the program normally receive most of their support from a combination of assistantships and fellowships. There are several types of assistantships: Teaching Assistants (TAs) run labs and do grading and other tasks for undergraduate classes; Research Assistantships (RAs) support students working on a faculty member’s project (20 hours/week); and students may be supported as Project Assistants (PAs) on their advisors’ external grants. Offer letters would also specify summer funding.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for independent fellowship support, as well as for funding to pay for research expenses, travel, etc. Obtaining independent funding is professionally as well as financially useful. See “useful links” below for some ideas about how to get started.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "11.1.1 Program policies and expectations\nSubject to satisfactory progress by the student, the Biological Sciences Graduate Program provides financial support up to the limit stated in the admission letter: normally two years (four semesters) of academic-year support for the M.S. degree and four years (eight semesters) of academic-year support for the Ph.D. A student who completes an M.S. and then continues as a Ph.D. candidate, or who converts from M.S. to Ph.D. enrollment, may anticipate a total of four years of support from the program.\nAdditional support may be available based on a clear need arising from the nature of the research (e.g. field projects that require two summers of data), and evidence of strong progress toward completion. A decision to request additional support must be made by the start of the final semester of guaranteed support. Where there is a compelling reason for an extension, the student’s advisor must present a written request for one additional semester of support from the program, explaining why the student needs more time to complete the degree. The Admissions Committee and Chair will review and decide on such requests. Approval is not automatic: students and advisors should not assume that extended support will be available if the degree is not completed on time.\nSince one purpose of limiting the duration of support is to encourage students to complete their degrees on schedule, students initially supported in other ways who later receive a Teaching or Research/Project Assistantship may not be entitled to the full duration of support stated above. All students will be advised of the extent of support they may expect at the time of admission.\nTeaching or Research/Project Assistantship appointments (see Chapter 5) are normally for the academic year, but can be terminated at the end of a semester if performance is unsatisfactory. With satisfactory performance in both research and teaching, the student, once appointed to an assistantship, can expect to be reappointed in subsequent years up to the limit specified upon admission.\nStudents who obtain their own funding (e.g. through a competitive fellowship, or part-time students working for state or federal agencies) are not penalized by a reduction of support from the program: they are still entitled to the full number of semesters stated in their admission letter.\n\n\n11.1.2 Support for graduate student travel and research expenses\nThe program has some funds available to support student travel. The student needs to submit a formal request to the Chair, detailing what meeting they are planning on attending, when and where the meeting will take place, whether they are presenting a poster or giving a talk, and a solid estimate of costs for meals, housing, etc. The Program will help pay for travel only if a student presents a poster or gives a talk – not if they are just attending the meeting. In the past, travel grants have been for up to $250. Students can request this once in a single fiscal year.\nThe Graduate School offers travel grants for graduate students who are presenting papers and posters at professional meetings and conferences. They generally do not support travel to workshops, seminars, and conferences where students are not presenting, but will consider such requests where the nature of the program is directly related to the student’s research agenda at UNH. Travel grants are also available to students who are attending professional development workshops and seminars that will enhance their research agendas. Travel grants will not exceed $200 per student per conference, or $400 per student per year. https://www.gradschool.unh.edu/php/travel_grant.php\nSee “Useful links” below for more possibilities.\n\n\n11.1.3 UNH Graduate School fellowships\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for the UNH Graduate School’s Summer TA Fellowship (provides partial support for one summer) and Dissertation Year Fellowship (provides support for the final year of Ph.D. work). Detailed information is available at http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/pdf/frm_aid.php .\nPre-application for Summer TA Fellowships. Summer TA Fellowships are allocated mainly on the basis of merit, but there is also consideration given to distributing them across programs – in fact, the Graduate School requires each program to rank their students who are applying, before applications are submitted. The likelihood of lots of students from the same program receiving awards is extremely low; rather, programs are most successful when they put forward a short list of their strongest applicants. To enable students and letter-writers to focus their time and energy where it will be most likely to pay off, the Biological Sciences Program has instituted a pre-application procedure. The Awards and Scholarship Committee is responsible for pre-applications and ranking, and will publicize the procedure to be followed, including a due date for pre-application materials. Note that students who do not follow this procedure will automatically be ranked at the bottom of the list of applicants from the program.",

The handbook is regularly revised and updated; please contact the Graduate School or search their website for a current version.\nEssential policies are stated in the Graduate Catalog: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/\nTeaching Assistantships, Research Assistantships, and Project Assistantships cover a stipend, health insurance, and the technology fee. Students are responsible for other mandatory fees.\n\n12.1.1 Teaching Assistantships\nAn opportunity to teach is an important part of every graduate student’s education. Most students in the program receive support as Teaching Assistants during at least part of their enrollment. Students not offered a teaching assistantship at the commencement of their enrollment are considered whenever positions become available, but presence in the program is not a guarantee of support.\nTeaching Assistants are half-time employees (20 hrs/week), with considerable responsibilities to their students and to the department/program. Teaching Assistantships are awarded by the Department Chair in consultation with the GPC. The process is complicated: it involves balancing teaching needs, student expertise, and fair allocation of resources.\nA Teaching Assistant’s performance is evaluated by the students in the course, who complete a formal course evaluation at the end of the semester. The results are available for the Teaching Assistant and the course supervisor. In addition, the instructor in whose course you serve as a TA should provide written evaluation and feedback at the end of the semester: this information is important for your annual progress review as well as for applications for Summer TA Fellowships (see Chapter 4).\nPoor performance as a Teaching Assistant may jeopardize continued funding.\n\n\n12.1.2 Research and Project Assistantships\nResearch/Project Assistantships may be available on specific research projects supported by external grants or contracts. Responsibility for filling a Research or Project Assistantship rests with the faculty member who administers the grant, with the proviso that any RA/PA appointed must be acceptable for admission as a graduate student. Tuition waivers are usually available for Research Assistants. The duration of support on an Assistantship is determined by the faculty member administering the grant. A student who makes insufficient progress or whose academic performance is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the program even though RA support remains available.\nIt is critical that the RA/PA and the project supervisor communicate clearly about expectations and responsibilities. Students owe the project that pays them 20 hours per week, as a condition of their appointment; but if it overlaps their own research (as is often the case), they may well be working on it much more than that.",
