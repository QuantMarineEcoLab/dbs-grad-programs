    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This handbook provides an overview and practical details of requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS). There are currently two graduate programs that exist within the department, the Integrative Biology and Marine Biology programs. While each program has specific curricular requirements, there remains much overlap between the two programs. Thus, this will serve as a general guide for being a graduate student in DBS with notes for each program as needed. Both programs, like all other graduate programs at UNH, are part of the UNH Graduate School; additional details, links, and resources for graduate students are available at the UNH Graduate School website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the department. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document (see Edit this page to the right. As a department member, you should have push access and not need to fork the repo). If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or contact Easton (easton.white@unh.edu).\n\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

    "text": "Welcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.\nWe offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior.\nWe prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect.\nOngoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall.\nBelow you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.\nEaston R. White, Ph.D.\nChair, Graduate Program Committee",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1.1 Do I need to contact prospective advisors before applying?\nYes! If you are interested in a MS or PhD program within UNH’s Department of Biological Sciences (three distinct programs: Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, Neuroscience & Behavior), you must contact potential thesis mentors (professors) before applying to our programs. You can find a directory of relevant mentors on the faculty webpage and under the individual program descriptions.\nIt is never too early to contact potential thesis mentors, but we suggest contacting them between August and October of the year before you expect to start your degree (for example, contact a mentor in September 2025 if interested in applying by January 2026 for full consideration to begin as a graduate student in Fall 2026). However, you should never be afraid to reach out to a prospective mentor as graduate opportunities can open throughout the year.\n\n\n3.1.2 How do I contact potential advisors?\nAfter identifying professors whose interest align with yours, send them an email to introduce yourself and your interests. This email should contain the following:\nA brief introduction of who you are and your current status\nYour interests broadly\nWhy you are interested in this professor’s work and how it aligns with your own interests\nAttachments of CV or resume, and unofficial transcripts\nStill intimidated? Use the text below labeled “Email Template” to help you contact a professor.\n\n\n3.1.3 Can I contact more than one professor in the Department of Biological Sciences or at UNH?\nAbsolutely! Graduate positions are very competitive, and often a professor can only take on one or two students each year (if any). Thus, it’s important to contact as many professors as possible, provided that their research aligns with your interests. You can let professors know who else you are contacting within the department or university when you contact them (see template below).\n\n\n3.1.4 What if I don’t get a response?\nTry again! Professors are very busy, and can receive hundreds of emails a day. Sometimes this results in slow reply times, or simply emails getting missed or lost. Wait at least a week, and then try to send again. If after three tries you still do not get a response, this likely means the professor is not taking on any graduate students in the near future.\n\n\n3.1.5 Are there fee waivers?\nYou might be eligible for a fee waiver after finding a prospective advisor that is open to supporting your application.\nI have a prospective advisor who has encouraged me to apply. What do I do now?\nOn the web pages for each program, you’ll see details on how to apply (dates, letters of recommendation needed, etc).\n\n\n3.1.6 What funding is available for graduate students?\nWhen you meet with a potential advisor, they’ll review available funding options with you. In most cases, we only admit students if we can support them financially (which typically includes waivers for health insurance and tuition) throughout their degree. Funding typically comes from a mix of graduate assistantships. Some students are supported through their advisor’s research grants, while many serve as teaching assistants in our biology labs (to be fully considered for assistantships, apply by the January deadline). The university also offers a limited number of fellowships, though these are usually awarded to current students rather than incoming ones. Additionally, some international students receive funding from their home governments or external fellowships such as those from the National Science Foundation or private foundations. Professor White maintains a list of some of these external fellowships.\n\n\n3.1.7 What are the requirements of each program?\nEach program differs a bit in their requirements (e.g., coursework requirements), so be sure to look through the individual program pages.\n\n\n3.1.8 Other general tips and advice for applying to graduate school:\nTake time to think about why you want to go to graduate school and conduct research (and communicate this clearly when reaching out to prospective mentors). Before contacting prospective mentors, take some time to learn about their research (either via webpages, their publications, or other resources). Get help from advisors, your university career centers, and others for updating your resume or CV, ensuring that you highlight any research or scientific experiences, important courses taken, skills, and awards received.\n\n\n3.1.9 Email Template\nIf you are potentially interested in working with one or more professors towards a MS or PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, you can use this template email to introduce yourself to these potential advisors.\nPlease note that you should contact each professor individually (it’s okay to contact more than one faculty member in our department!); individualize your responses to each professor, particularly paragraphs #2 and #3). Also know that this is simply a template; prospective students do not need to follow these instructions exactly when reaching out to prospective mentors. We just hope this helps you get started and give you confidence in contacting faculty!\nDear Dr. [insert professor’s full name here]:\nParagraph 1: Introduce yourself! State your name, educational status and history (including GPA and major and/or degree. If you have graduated, include when you graduated and your current position.), and what semester and year you are aiming to start your graduate studies.\nParagraph 2: Discuss your relevant qualifications and experience that make you an ideal candidate for our graduate program. This may include specific skills you have, research experiences, internships, publications or presentations, and relevant coursework.\nParagraph 3: Describe your specific interests within the field of Biological Sciences? How do these interests align with this professor’s work? What about this professor’s work excites you? Be specific when possible, demonstrating your own efforts to understand this professor’s research.\nThank you for your time in reading this email and your consideration. I have attached my [resume/CV; make sure to attach!] and unofficial transcripts [attach]. I would enjoy an opportunity to chat with you further about potential opportunities as a graduate student in your research group.\nSincerely,\n[Insert your full name here]",
