    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This handbook provides an overview and practical details of requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS). There are currently two graduate programs that exist within the department, the Integrative Biology and Marine Biology programs. While each program has specific curricular requirements, there remains much overlap between the two programs. Thus, this will serve as a general guide for being a graduate student in DBS with notes for each program as needed. Both programs, like all other graduate programs at UNH, are part of the UNH Graduate School; additional details, links, and resources for graduate students are available at the UNH Graduate School website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the department. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document (see Edit this page to the right. As a department member, you should have push access and not need to fork the repo). If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or contact Easton (easton.white@unh.edu).\n\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

    "text": "Welcome to the online hub for graduate studies in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNH. We are a broad department with interests spanning microbes to ecosystems. We currently have just over 40 graduate students in the department in both our MS and PhD programs. We accept around 10 students into the programs each year.\nWe offer MS and PhD degrees in Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, and Neuroscience & Behavior.\nWe prioritize community and culture within our department. We have a weekly coffee hour, a regular seminar series, and other informal ways to connect.\nOngoing work in the department is closely tied to the UNH collections, the NH Agricultural Experimental Station, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering (SMSOE), and other UNH research center and institutes. Many graduate students work at one of our three(!) marine field stations in addition to facilities in our newly renovated Spaulding Hall.\nBelow you’ll find information for prospective students (including how to apply) and documents relevant to current students. Most information for current students exists in the department Sharepoint. If you have questions, please reach out to me, the coordinators listed on the program pages or DBS Academic Program Manager.\nEaston R. White, Ph.D.\nChair, Graduate Program Committee\n\nAs a department, we voted to adopt the Healthy Research Teams & Labs framework where we agree to the following seven principles.\n\nSetting clear expectations for advising and mentorship and engaging in practices that help foster positive, productive, and fulfilling relationships. We recognize the importance of supportive advisory relationships in facilitating personal, academic, and professional development of research team members.\n\nCreating an environment where the welfare of all research team members is prioritized. We recognize that our research team’s best work is more likely to be achieved when members feel welcome, supported, and encouraged to strive toward professional and personal goals.\n\nExplicitly stating our commitment to fair practices. We recognize that clearly stating our commitment helps to ensure graduate students are given fair attention and opportunities.\n\nEncouraging collaboration rather than competition within our research teams and labs. We understand the important role that a collaborative and supportive environment has in fostering success and well-being of research team members.\n\nEngaging in continual learning to refine skills in research leadership and management. We recognize the importance of elevating our advising and mentorship, research management, and leadership skills through ongoing professional development.\n\nPromoting professional development opportunities for a variety of career paths. We understand graduate students have diverse career aspirations and we play a significant role in encouraging them to engage in a variety of professional development activities.\n\nEncouraging students to be curious, innovative, and open in their work. We understand that research integrity and rigor can be achieved when students are encouraged to be curious, collaborative, and open throughout the research process.\n\n\n#Summary of Shared Requirements M.S. Degree: o 30 credit hours total, with 10 maximum being research credit o Thesis proposal, OKed by thesis committee o Public presentation and thesis defense with committee\nPh.D. Degree: o Variable credit hours dependent on program, and guidance committee recommendations o Thesis proposal, OKed by thesis committee o Written and oral comprehensive exams o Public presentation and dissertation defense with committee\nThe M.S. degree should normally be completed in two years. The University requires that all graduate work for any master’s degree must be completed within six years from the date of enrollment in the program.\nThe Ph.D. degree should normally be completed within five years (three years for students entering with a master’s degree). All graduate work for the Ph.D. must be completed within eight years of enrollment, or within seven years if the student entered with a master’s degree in the same field. Per University policy, the student must be advanced to candidacy within five years after enrollment or within four years if the student entered with a master’s in the same field. In DBS, we encourage students to advance to candidacy in the second or third year. Students and research projects do not all progress at the same pace. The timelines are offered as a guide, but departure from them is permissible when circumstances warrant. There are, however, some firm Graduate School deadlines that must be adhered to: see https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/graduate-school-academic-calendar for details.",

Typically, prospective graduate students begin reaching out to our faculty the summer or Fall before they intend to apply. Early conversation helps with planning as faculty have to secure funds to support students.\nPriority will be given to students that apply by our December deadlines. A departmental admissions committee reviews applications through December and January. Typically, we start making offers around mid February. Students have until April 15th to formally accept or decline our offer. Between mid Feb and Apr, we may make additional offers as students accept or decline and if new funding becomes available.",

    "text": "3.2 Prospective Students\nPlease consider watching this webinar recording that provides an introduction to graduate school in general and information about our specific programs. The webinar also includes a Q&A with current graduate students.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Do I need to contact prospective advisors before applying?\nYes! If you are interested in a MS or PhD program within UNH’s Department of Biological Sciences (three distinct programs: Integrative Biology, Marine Biology, Neuroscience & Behavior), you must contact potential thesis mentors (professors) before applying to our programs. You can find a directory of relevant mentors on the faculty webpage and under the individual program descriptions.\nIt is never too early to contact potential thesis mentors, but we suggest contacting them between August and October of the year before you expect to start your degree (for example, contact a mentor in September 2025 if interested in applying by January 2026 for full consideration to begin as a graduate student in Fall 2026). However, you should never be afraid to reach out to a prospective mentor as graduate opportunities can open throughout the year.\n\n\n3.2.2 How do I contact potential advisors?\nAfter identifying professors whose interest align with yours, send them an email to introduce yourself and your interests. This email should contain the following:\nA brief introduction of who you are and your current status\nYour interests broadly\nWhy you are interested in this professor’s work and how it aligns with your own interests\nAttachments of CV or resume, and unofficial transcripts\nStill intimidated? Use the text below labeled “Email Template” to help you contact a professor.\n\n\n3.2.3 Can I contact more than one professor in the Department of Biological Sciences or at UNH?\nAbsolutely! Graduate positions are very competitive, and often a professor can only take on one or two students each year (if any). Thus, it’s important to contact as many professors as possible, provided that their research aligns with your interests. You can let professors know who else you are contacting within the department or university when you contact them (see template below).\n\n\n3.2.4 What if I don’t get a response?\nTry again! Professors are very busy, and can receive hundreds of emails a day. Sometimes this results in slow reply times, or simply emails getting missed or lost. Wait at least a week, and then try to send again. If after three tries you still do not get a response, this likely means the professor is not taking on any graduate students in the near future.\n\n\n3.2.5 Are there fee waivers?\nYou might be eligible for a fee waiver after finding a prospective advisor that is open to supporting your application.\nI have a prospective advisor who has encouraged me to apply. What do I do now?\nOn the web pages for each program, you’ll see details on how to apply (dates, letters of recommendation needed, etc).\n\n\n3.2.6 What funding is available for graduate students?\nWhen you meet with a potential advisor, they’ll review available funding options with you. In most cases, we only admit students if we can support them financially (which typically includes waivers for health insurance and tuition) throughout their degree. Funding typically comes from a mix of graduate assistantships. Some students are supported through their advisor’s research grants, while many serve as teaching assistants in our biology labs (to be fully considered for assistantships, apply by the January deadline). The university also offers a limited number of fellowships, though these are usually awarded to current students rather than incoming ones. Additionally, some international students receive funding from their home governments or external fellowships such as those from the National Science Foundation or private foundations. Professor White maintains a list of some of these external fellowships.\n\n\n3.2.7 What are the requirements of each program?\nEach program differs a bit in their requirements (e.g., coursework requirements), so be sure to look through the individual program pages.\n\n\n3.2.8 Other general tips and advice for applying to graduate school:\nTake time to think about why you want to go to graduate school and conduct research (and communicate this clearly when reaching out to prospective mentors). Before contacting prospective mentors, take some time to learn about their research (either via webpages, their publications, or other resources). Get help from advisors, your university career centers, and others for updating your resume or CV, ensuring that you highlight any research or scientific experiences, important courses taken, skills, and awards received.\n\n\n3.2.9 Email Template\nIf you are potentially interested in working with one or more professors towards a MS or PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, you can use this template email to introduce yourself to these potential advisors.\nPlease note that you should contact each professor individually (it’s okay to contact more than one faculty member in our department!); individualize your responses to each professor, particularly paragraphs #2 and #3). Also know that this is simply a template; prospective students do not need to follow these instructions exactly when reaching out to prospective mentors. We just hope this helps you get started and give you confidence in contacting faculty!\nDear Dr. [insert professor’s full name here]:\nParagraph 1: Introduce yourself! State your name, educational status and history (including GPA and major and/or degree. If you have graduated, include when you graduated and your current position.), and what semester and year you are aiming to start your graduate studies.\nParagraph 2: Discuss your relevant qualifications and experience that make you an ideal candidate for our graduate program. This may include specific skills you have, research experiences, internships, publications or presentations, and relevant coursework.\nParagraph 3: Describe your specific interests within the field of Biological Sciences? How do these interests align with this professor’s work? What about this professor’s work excites you? Be specific when possible, demonstrating your own efforts to understand this professor’s research.\nThank you for your time in reading this email and your consideration. I have attached my [resume/CV; make sure to attach!] and unofficial transcripts [attach]. I would enjoy an opportunity to chat with you further about potential opportunities as a graduate student in your research group.\nSincerely,\n[Insert your full name here]",

    "section": "5.3 Program Requirements and Timeline",
    "text": "5.3 Program Requirements and Timeline\n\n5.3.1 Committee\nCommittees are comprised of three people: your advisor, another DBS faculty member, and someone external to the department.\n\n\n5.3.2 Thesis Proposal Guidelines\nPURPOSE A thesis proposal states a problem to be investigated and describes how the research will be performed and reported. An approved thesis proposal documents an agreement between the student and the Marine Biology Graduate Program regarding the contents of a satisfactory thesis or dissertation. The preparation and writing of the thesis are of utmost importance and the student is expected to seek the guidance of their major professor and committee in the formation of the final thesis product. Adherence to the guidelines given here should assure the student that all information necessary for the satisfactory evaluation of the plans for master’s or doctoral research will be included in the proposal.\nFORMAT The thesis proposal should present the required information concisely and clearly. The ability to describe concisely a research problem and methodology is one of the skills that the proposal process is designed to develop. Therefore, all thesis proposals are limited in length to the signature coversheet plus 20 or fewer double-spaced, single-sided or double-sided, numbered pages in a font size no smaller than 12 point. Proposals longer than this will not be accepted, however, appendices and references are not included in the 15-page limit, and must be numbered separately, using lower-case Roman numerals.\nCONTENTS Thesis Proposals shall contain the following sections, presented in the order shown:\nA. Title of the Study This is the title as the student conceives it at the time the proposal is submitted. This title must match the title on the thesis proposal approval form. As the research develops, minor rephrasing of the title may prove better suited to the work. In such cases, the most satisfactory one will be used for the thesis, but in no case will a title that deviates substantially from the one approved in the original proposal be approved unless a revised proposal with the new title has already been approved. Any title used must be consistent with the contents and subject of the thesis.\nB. Statement of the Problem Limit the statement, if possible, to two or three sentences, and note in precise language exactly what is to be investigated. To amplify the statement, it is usually desirable to list:\nThe scope or limitations of the problem;\nEither one or more hypotheses the research seeks to test, or the objectives expected\nC. Justification for and Significance of the Study This section of the proposal includes:\nA brief statement of the reason for the selection of the problem;\nThe relation of the principal literature to the proposal;\nAn explanation of the study’s importance to the advancement of knowledge and its significance to the student.\nThe problem selected should be substantial enough to constitute a good example of a report of a scholarly investigation. At the PhD level the work should constitute a significant increase in the pool of knowledge.\nD. Methodology or Procedures This section describes the activities necessary to achieve the objectives. Methods should flow naturally from the problems and objectives, and may include depending on the field of study:\nA research design;\nGeneral characteristics of the study population;\nLocation or setting in which the study will take place, calendar events in carrying out the study; Sampling design and procedures;\nData collection schedule;\nBrief description of instruments and tools for collecting data (validity, reliability, and pretesting of the data collecting instruments);\nDefinition of the most important terms and concepts;\nData processing procedures and procedures of data analysis as appropriate.\nE. Broader Impacts\nIn this section the student should put the potential findings of their research into a broader context. Some questions to address in this section:\nWhat is the intellectual merit of doing this study?\nHow will the field of knowledge around your thesis topic be moved forward upon completion of your work?\nWhy will the scientific community and society at large care about the outcomes of your research?\nF. Literature Cited in the Proposal It is important that students demonstrate that they have investigated the literature in framing the problem to be studied.\nG. Appendix\nAppendices can be listed after the Literature Cited section. In these appendices students should include information that is outside the scope of the thesis proposal. These items may include:\nExtended methodologies\nPreliminary data\nIACUC or IRB approval documents\nTIMING Thesis proposals should be submitted before substantial research has been completed. Typically, it should be submitted before or during the first semester in which the student registers for research credits. In all cases, however, the proposal must be submitted at least one semester before the semester in which the thesis itself is to be submitted and defended. For dissertations, the proposal must be submitted at least six (6) months prior to the defense.\nStudents must submit an MBGP Proposal Approval form, with the required signatures, along with the proposal to the MBGP Coordinator. Please only send electronic copies of these documents.\nREVISED PROPOSALS If, as the research proceeds, a significant change in subject or methodology becomes necessary, a revised proposal should be submitted. Sometimes an abbreviated format can be used for such changes. The student, in consultation with their major professor, should contact the MBGP Coordinator for further guidance.\n\n\n5.3.3 Credit Requirements\nThe M.S. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits, 6-¬10 of which are earned for thesis research (BIOL 899 Master’s Thesis ).\nThere is no specific credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must meet curriculum requirements.\nUp to 8 graduate credits from another institution may be transferred, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the course grade was a B or higher. Petitions requesting transfer credit must be supported by the advisor and graduate committee, and approved by the UNH Graduate School. Students admitted via the Accelerated Master’s (AM) process may apply up to 12 credits of prior upper-level UNH coursework in accordance with AM policies.\nThe level of the courses taken to meet registration requirements is not specified. However, taking non-graduate classes does not move one towards degree completion, so taking undergraduate classes is not a common practice. A grad student cannot petition to take a 500-level course, however 500-level courses can be audited by graduate students with the cost of the course at the expense of the graduate student.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor and committee which courses will be most useful, and what course load makes sense in light of specific research and assistantship obligations (for example, an intense field season).\nHow many credits to take, and financial implications:\nGraduate students are normally required to maintain continuous enrollment each Fall and Spring semester by registering for courses, research (Grad 900/BIOL 999), or continuing enrollment (Grad 800) (see below for distinctions). Students who don’t register for the Fall and Spring semesters will have their degree status discontinued.\nGraduate students registered for 9 or more credits, Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900), or Doctoral Research (999) are classified as full-time students. Students holding assistantship appointments are also considered full time and must register for a minimum of 6 credits, or Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900). Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B. The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n5.3.4 Research Proposal\nM.S. students must have their proposal approved by their advisor and Thesis Committee by the end of the second semester.\n\n\n5.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n5.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n5.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n5.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates. It can be found at https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/ See Graduate School Catalog for general information, policies, and student rights: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/",

    "text": "6.3 Program Requirements and Timeline\n\n6.3.1 Committee\nCommittees are comprised of five people: your advisor, another DBS faculty member, and three additional people. At least two committee members must be external to DBS. Members of UNH must be part of the graduate faculty (which is an easy application if they aren’t already graduate faculty). For non-UNH members, you must submit a CV on their behalf. All committee members should have a PhD or commensurate experience.\n\n\n6.3.2 Credit Requirements\nThe M.S. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits, 6-¬10 of which are earned for thesis research (BIOL 899 Master’s Thesis ).\nThere is no specific credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must meet curriculum requirements.\nUp to 8 graduate credits from another institution may be transferred, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the course grade was a B or higher. Petitions requesting transfer credit must be supported by the advisor and graduate committee, and approved by the UNH Graduate School. Students admitted via the Accelerated Master’s (AM) process may apply up to 12 credits of prior upper-level UNH coursework in accordance with AM policies.\nThe level of the courses taken to meet registration requirements is not specified. However, taking non-graduate classes does not move one towards degree completion, so taking undergraduate classes is not a common practice. A grad student cannot petition to take a 500-level course, however 500-level courses can be audited by graduate students with the cost of the course at the expense of the graduate student.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor and committee which courses will be most useful, and what course load makes sense in light of specific research and assistantship obligations (for example, an intense field season).\nHow many credits to take, and financial implications:\nGraduate students are normally required to maintain continuous enrollment each Fall and Spring semester by registering for courses, research (Grad 900/BIOL 999), or continuing enrollment (Grad 800) (see below for distinctions). Students who don’t register for the Fall and Spring semesters will have their degree status discontinued.\nGraduate students registered for 9 or more credits, Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900), or Doctoral Research (999) are classified as full-time students. Students holding assistantship appointments are also considered full time and must register for a minimum of 6 credits, or Doctoral Research (999) each semester. Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nDoctoral students who have advanced to candidacy may petition each semester to waive fees if they meet the specified conditions (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B. The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n6.3.3 Change of Degree Status, M.S. to Ph.D. Enrollment\nM.S. graduates normally go elsewhere for further study or for employment after completing their thesis. However, students enrolled for an M.S. degree may petition the Graduate School to continue for the Ph.D. after receipt of the M.S. or, rarely, to convert to Ph.D. enrollment without first completing the M.S. If a student wishes to convert from M.S. to Ph.D., the advisor will convene a meeting of the DBS GPC and the student’s Master’s Thesis Committee to consider the application. If the application has departmental support, a “change of degree” form is then completed and submitted for Graduate School approval (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nAdmission to Ph.D. enrollment should not be considered automatic on completion of the M.S., and conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment is done only in extraordinary circumstances. Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the third semester of enrollment.\nStudents who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Further information is available at https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh.\n\n\n6.3.4 Research Proposal\nPh.D. students present and defend their formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee in order to be advanced to candidacy, normally in the second or third year. However, a solid draft of the proposal should be shared with the committee by the end of the second semester, and presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably for a wider (public) audience.\nPlease contact individual Program Coordinators to find guidance in terms of proposal length and format.\nPh.D. qualifying exam and advancement to candidacy\nFollowing approval of the research proposal by their committee, students who wish to be admitted to doctoral candidacy must pass a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the project. The student is responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam; plan well ahead to account for committee members’ travel plans, sabbaticals, etc. The written portion of the qualifying exam should be taken no later than the end of the fifth semester, though it may be delayed beyond that point if necessary. The oral portion of the exam follows successful completion of the written part, usually within a few weeks.\nStudent’s should contact their respective degree programs to be provided specific details regarding the procedure of both the written and oral comprehensive exam.\nWhen the student has passed both parts of the qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program by submitting the appropriate form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) . At this point, the student’s Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be nominated using the Graduate School form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) .\n\n\n6.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n6.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n6.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n6.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates. It can be found at https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/ See Graduate School Catalog for general information, policies, and student rights: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/",

The transfer request form is available at (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nWhere to find enrollment policy, course and registration information: • Graduate School enrollment policies and petition forms: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies • the UNH Course Search Form searches all courses (grad and undergrad) (https://courses.unh.edu/)https://courses.unh.edu/ • descriptions of graduate courses are in the online catalog https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/ • registration information and deadlines are posted at the Graduate School website https://gradschool.unh.edu/graduate-student-resources\n\n\n8.3.3 Change of Degree Status, M.S. to Ph.D. Enrollment\nM.S. graduates normally go elsewhere for further study or for employment after completing their thesis. However, students enrolled for an M.S. degree may petition the Graduate School to continue for the Ph.D. after receipt of the M.S. or, rarely, to convert to Ph.D. enrollment without first completing the M.S. If a student wishes to convert from M.S. to Ph.D., the advisor will convene a meeting of the DBS GPC and the student’s Master’s Thesis Committee to consider the application. If the application has departmental support, a “change of degree” form is then completed and submitted for Graduate School approval (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies).\nAdmission to Ph.D. enrollment should not be considered automatic on completion of the M.S., and conversion from M.S. directly to Ph.D. enrollment is done only in extraordinary circumstances. Conversion, when appropriate, should occur no later than the beginning of the third semester of enrollment.\nStudents who change to a Ph.D. program (and have not already done so) are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Further information is available at https://www.unh.edu/research/rcr-training-unh.\n\n\n8.3.4 Research Proposal\nPh.D. students present and defend their formal research proposal to their Guidance Committee in order to be advanced to candidacy, normally in the second or third year. However, a solid draft of the proposal should be shared with the committee by the end of the second semester, and presented in seminar form at least to the committee, and preferably for a wider (public) audience.\nPlease contact individual Program Coordinators to find guidance in terms of proposal length and format.\nPh.D. qualifying exam and advancement to candidacy\nFollowing approval of the research proposal by their committee, students who wish to be admitted to doctoral candidacy must pass a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the project. The student is responsible for scheduling both parts of the exam; plan well ahead to account for committee members’ travel plans, sabbaticals, etc. The written portion of the qualifying exam should be taken no later than the end of the fifth semester, though it may be delayed beyond that point if necessary. The oral portion of the exam follows successful completion of the written part, usually within a few weeks.\nStudent’s should contact their respective degree programs to be provided specific details regarding the procedure of both the written and oral comprehensive exam.\nWhen the student has passed both parts of the qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program by submitting the appropriate form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) . At this point, the student’s Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be nominated using the Graduate School form (https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies) .\n\n\n8.3.5 Annual Progress Report and Review Meeting\nEach student will meet with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee in the spring semester to review progress and identify any concerns. The purpose of this meeting is to:\n\nEncourage the student to think critically about his/her own progress (or lack thereof) and goals for both the immediate and long-term future.\nIncrease a sense of accountability on behalf of graduate students, and motivate students moving at a slow pace to increase their productivity and involvement in the program.\nRemind students that to be a truly successful graduate student, one should (ideally) demonstrate success in multiple areas (research, funding, teaching, service), and provide examples for how to do that.\nProvide a clear paper trail in case situations arise in which there is confusion or disagreement about a student’s progress.\n\nThe annual meeting also provides an opportunity for students to raise any concerns, and provide feedback about the program and their graduate experience.\nIn preparation for progress review meetings, • The student writes a report about their progress, and submits it to their advisor and committee for review and comments. This should occur in the first half of the spring semester. Instructions and template for the student report are available at the program website, or from the department. • The advisor reviews and signs the student’s report, and then also fills out an evaluation describing his/her view of the student’s progress, and including a summary of the most recent committee meeting – which should take place earlier in the same semester. Instructions and template for the advisor report are available at the program website, or from the department. Reports must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April. • Instructors for whom the student has served as a teaching assistant provide comments on their teaching. (If instructors have previously provided feedback as part of fellowship or other applications, they needn’t do so again.) Comments must be submitted at least one week before scheduled meetings, normally by mid-April.\nAll reports and comments will be submitted to the designated departmental staff person, who will schedule a review meeting for each student with a member of the GPC (not including the advisor or, preferably, other members of the student’s committee), normally between mid-April and mid-May.\nFollowing the meetings, comments and suggestions will be shared with the student and advisor, as well as the Program Coordinator. If there is material in the comments that is confidential or should not be shared, it may be withheld at the discretion of the Program Coordinator.\nStudents who do not complete the review process by the specified date will have a hold placed on their registration by the Graduate School until they have resolved the situation.\n\n\n8.3.6 Completing the Degree\nAs a graduate student, you are responsible for knowing what you need to do to get your degree: your advisor and committee should offer guidance, but the primary responsibility is yours. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with:\n• the program’s academic requirements (credits, courses, competencies); • necessary paperwork (committee nomination, Ph.D. candidacy, etc.); • thesis/dissertation format and filing requirements (set by the Graduate School); • format and scheduling procedures for qualifying exams and thesis/dissertation defense; and all relevant deadlines.\nIf you have questions about what you need to do, or how to do it, consult your advisor, the Program Coordinator, and/or the UNH Graduate School. If there is information you think needs to be added or clarified in this handbook, please tell the Program Coordinator.\nFor both the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation students are required to give a public, advertised seminar on the UNH campus, followed by a private examination by the student’s committee, which may require revisions. The committee is responsible for assessing and approving the final version of the thesis. The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n8.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php\n\n\n8.3.8 Student Rights and Key Policies\nUNH’s statement on Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities applies to graduate students as well as to undergraduates.

    "text": "9.3 Program Requirements and Timeline\n\n9.3.1 Credit Requirements\nThe M.S. degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credits, 6-¬10 of which are earned for thesis research (BIOL 899 Master’s Thesis ).\nThere is no specific credit requirement for the Ph.D., though students must meet curriculum requirements.\nUp to 8 graduate credits from another institution may be transferred, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the course grade was a B or higher. Petitions requesting transfer credit must be supported by the advisor and graduate committee, and approved by the UNH Graduate School. Students admitted via the Accelerated Master’s (AM) process may apply up to 12 credits of prior upper-level UNH coursework in accordance with AM policies.\nThe level of the courses taken to meet registration requirements is not specified. However, taking non-graduate classes does not move one towards degree completion, so taking undergraduate classes is not a common practice. A grad student cannot petition to take a 500-level course, however 500-level courses can be audited by graduate students with the cost of the course at the expense of the graduate student.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor and committee which courses will be most useful, and what course load makes sense in light of specific research and assistantship obligations (for example, an intense field season).\nHow many credits to take, and financial implications:\nGraduate students are normally required to maintain continuous enrollment each Fall and Spring semester by registering for courses, research (Grad 900/BIOL 999), or continuing enrollment (Grad 800) (see below for distinctions). Students who don’t register for the Fall and Spring semesters will have their degree status discontinued.\nGraduate students registered for 9 or more credits, Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900), or Doctoral Research (999) are classified as full-time students. Students holding assistantship appointments are also considered full time and must register for a minimum of 6 credits, or Master’s Continuing Research (Grad 900). Students registered for Continuing Enrollment (GRAD 800) are not eligible to hold an appointment. For details, please see the Graduate School website (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course- descriptions/grad).\nStudents on assistantships (TA or RA) pay reduced mandatory fees (fee information: https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad); this benefit applies no matter how many credits you’re taking. Tuition is commonly waived or covered for students on TA or RA appointments; however, mandatory fees remain the responsibility of the student. Students on assistantship in the spring semester can have tuition waived for summer courses offered by the Graduate School (GRAD prefix).\nStudents enrolled for more than 16 credits pay additional tuition based on the number of additional credits (https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad).\nTuition and fee information from UNH Business Services is available at https://www.unh.edu/business-services/tuitgrad; Graduate School information about fees and financial support is at https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/fees-financial-support/ .\nWhich courses count:\nGraduate courses are numbered 800- or 900-level. Course descriptions can be found in the online Graduate Course Catalog (https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/). If there is a graded option, graduate courses may not be taken Pass/Fail.\nGraduate credit for 700-level courses: 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in 700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are approved by the student’s adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies.\nUndergraduate courses below 700-level: While taking non-graduate classes is generally discouraged, in some cases, graduate students may need background or training that can best be obtained by taking an upper-level undergraduate class, if no equivalent course is offered at the graduate level. Undergraduate level courses taken by graduate students are billed at the graduate rate, must be taken for a letter grade, and are subject to the Graduate School’s failing grade policy. Courses taken below the 700-level cannot count as graduate credit.\nAudits: Graduate students may audit courses with the approval of their advisor and the instructor. Credits for an audited course in which a graduate student is formally enrolled may be counted toward enrollment requirements for appointments and assistantships. (Note that tuition for audited courses is the same as for credit courses.)\nGraduate credit from another institution: Students can request to transfer up to 8 credits of graduate credit from another school, provided the credits were not counted toward another degree, and the grade was at least a B.

The committee should be provided with a complete copy of the thesis for review at least two full weeks before the defense.\nThe student is responsible for transmitting necessary paperwork to the Graduate School, and fulfilling Graduate School requirements for electronic submission of the thesis, by the appropriate deadline.\n\n\n10.3.7 Graduation\nThe Graduate School website provides detailed information on graduation procedures, including deadlines, filing “intent to graduate” notification, submitting theses/dissertations to the Graduate School, and Commencement: http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/graduation.php",

    "text": "11.1 General information\nGraduate students in the program normally receive most of their support from a combination of assistantships and fellowships. There are several types of assistantships: Teaching Assistants (TAs) run labs and do grading and other tasks for undergraduate classes; Research Assistantships (RAs) support students working on a faculty member’s project (20 hours/week); and students may be supported as Project Assistants (PAs) on their advisors’ external grants. See Chapter 5 for more information about assistantships.\nInstitutional support during the summer is not guaranteed at the time of admission; however, summer support is available from several sources, e.g.\n• The Graduate School offers competitive summer fellowships for TAs (see below). Since these fellowships provide only partial support, advisors are strongly encouraged to make up the difference from other sources for their students who win fellowships. (To quote an old Harvard staff union slogan, “you can’t eat prestige.”)\n• Advisors often have other sources of funds with which to provide summer support.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for independent fellowship support, as well as for funding to pay for research expenses, travel, etc. Obtaining independent funding is professionally as well as financially useful. See “useful links” below for some ideas about how to get started.",

    "text": "11.1.1 Program policies and expectations\nSubject to satisfactory progress by the student, the Biological Sciences Graduate Program provides financial support up to the limit stated in the admission letter: normally two years (four semesters) of academic-year support for the M.S. degree and four years (eight semesters) of academic-year support for the Ph.D. A student who completes an M.S. and then continues as a Ph.D. candidate, or who converts from M.S. to Ph.D. enrollment, may anticipate a total of four years of support from the program.\nAdditional support may be available based on a clear need arising from the nature of the research (e.g. field projects that require two summers of data), and evidence of strong progress toward completion. A decision to request additional support must be made by the start of the final semester of guaranteed support. Where there is a compelling reason for an extension, the student’s advisor must present a written request for one additional semester of support from the program, explaining why the student needs more time to complete the degree. The Admissions Committee and Chair will review and decide on such requests. Approval is not automatic: students and advisors should not assume that extended support will be available if the degree is not completed on time.\nSince one purpose of limiting the duration of support is to encourage students to complete their degrees on schedule, students initially supported in other ways who later receive a Teaching or Research/Project Assistantship may not be entitled to the full duration of support stated above. All students will be advised of the extent of support they may expect at the time of admission.\nTeaching or Research/Project Assistantship appointments (see Chapter 5) are normally for the academic year, but can be terminated at the end of a semester if performance is unsatisfactory. With satisfactory performance in both research and teaching, the student, once appointed to an assistantship, can expect to be reappointed in subsequent years up to the limit specified upon admission.\nStudents who obtain their own funding (e.g. through a competitive fellowship, or part-time students working for state or federal agencies) are not penalized by a reduction of support from the program: they are still entitled to the full number of semesters stated in their admission letter.\n\n\n11.1.2 Support for graduate student travel and research expenses\nThe program has some funds available to support student travel. The student needs to submit a formal request to the Chair, detailing what meeting they are planning on attending, when and where the meeting will take place, whether they are presenting a poster or giving a talk, and a solid estimate of costs for meals, housing, etc. The Program will help pay for travel only if a student presents a poster or gives a talk – not if they are just attending the meeting. In the past, travel grants have been for up to $250. Students can request this once in a single fiscal year.\nThe Graduate School offers travel grants for graduate students who are presenting papers and posters at professional meetings and conferences. They generally do not support travel to workshops, seminars, and conferences where students are not presenting, but will consider such requests where the nature of the program is directly related to the student’s research agenda at UNH. Travel grants are also available to students who are attending professional development workshops and seminars that will enhance their research agendas. Travel grants will not exceed $200 per student per conference, or $400 per student per year. https://www.gradschool.unh.edu/php/travel_grant.php\nSee “Useful links” below for more possibilities.\n\n\n11.1.3 UNH Graduate School fellowships\nStudents are strongly encouraged to apply for the UNH Graduate School’s Summer TA Fellowship (provides partial support for one summer) and Dissertation Year Fellowship (provides support for the final year of Ph.D. work). Detailed information is available at http://www.gradschool.unh.edu/pdf/frm_aid.php .\nPre-application for Summer TA Fellowships. Summer TA Fellowships are allocated mainly on the basis of merit, but there is also consideration given to distributing them across programs – in fact, the Graduate School requires each program to rank their students who are applying, before applications are submitted. The likelihood of lots of students from the same program receiving awards is extremely low; rather, programs are most successful when they put forward a short list of their strongest applicants. To enable students and letter-writers to focus their time and energy where it will be most likely to pay off, the Biological Sciences Program has instituted a pre-application procedure. The Awards and Scholarship Committee is responsible for pre-applications and ranking, and will publicize the procedure to be followed, including a due date for pre-application materials. Note that students who do not follow this procedure will automatically be ranked at the bottom of the list of applicants from the program.",

The handbook is regularly revised and updated; please contact the Graduate School or search their website for a current version.\nEssential policies are stated in the Graduate Catalog: https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/\nTeaching Assistantships, Research Assistantships, and Project Assistantships cover a stipend, health insurance, and the technology fee. Students are responsible for other mandatory fees.\n\n12.1.1 Teaching Assistantships\nAn opportunity to teach is an important part of every graduate student’s education. Most students in the program receive support as Teaching Assistants during at least part of their enrollment. Students not offered a teaching assistantship at the commencement of their enrollment are considered whenever positions become available, but presence in the program is not a guarantee of support.\nTeaching Assistants are half-time employees (20 hrs/week), with considerable responsibilities to their students and to the department/program. Teaching Assistantships are awarded by the Department Chair in consultation with the GPC. The process is complicated: it involves balancing teaching needs, student expertise, and fair allocation of resources.\nA Teaching Assistant’s performance is evaluated by the students in the course, who complete a formal course evaluation at the end of the semester. The results are available for the Teaching Assistant and the course supervisor. In addition, the instructor in whose course you serve as a TA should provide written evaluation and feedback at the end of the semester: this information is important for your annual progress review as well as for applications for Summer TA Fellowships (see Chapter 4).\nPoor performance as a Teaching Assistant may jeopardize continued funding.\n\n\n12.1.2 Research and Project Assistantships\nResearch/Project Assistantships may be available on specific research projects supported by external grants or contracts. Responsibility for filling a Research or Project Assistantship rests with the faculty member who administers the grant, with the proviso that any RA/PA appointed must be acceptable for admission as a graduate student. Tuition waivers are usually available for Research Assistants. The duration of support on an Assistantship is determined by the faculty member administering the grant. A student who makes insufficient progress or whose academic performance is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the program even though RA support remains available.\nIt is critical that the RA/PA and the project supervisor communicate clearly about expectations and responsibilities. Students owe the project that pays them 20 hours per week, as a condition of their appointment; but if it overlaps their own research (as is often the case), they may well be working on it much more than that.",
