# Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and Other UNH Policies
Graduate students, like all other researchers, must comply with all rules and policies that are relevant to their work. It’s your responsibility to know about, and follow, the rules that may apply to your project. Begin by consulting your advisor, but be aware that you may have to deal with additional issues, if your project extends beyond your advisor’s (e.g. they work on inverts but your project will also involve fish; or they work on crops, but you will also be interviewing farmers). The go-to place for information – for instance, figuring out exactly which rules and policies apply to your research – is Research Integrity Services (https://www.unh.edu/research/support-units/research-integrity-services).

## Requirements and training

All new Ph.D. students and students who have changed to a Ph.D. program are required to attend the Responsible Conduct of Research Training. Information is at https://gradschool.unh.edu/research/responsible-conduct-research-rcr-training.

If you work with vertebrate animals in any aspect of your research or teaching, you need prior approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, as well as the required training (online module and in-person session). This includes field and observation studies as well as lab work and research with domesticated animals. If your research supervisor or the person for whom you are TAing already has approval for the activity, you just need to do the training and submit the medical questionnaire – then you can be added to their approval. Details and forms are available at http://www.unh.edu/research/animal-care-use.

If your research will involve human subjects in any way (including surveys), you should check if you will need approval from the Institutional Review Board. Seehttps://www.unh.edu/research/human-subjects.
