# M.S. Neuroscience & Behavior

## Program Description

### Degree Overview

The M.S. in Neuroscience & Behavior is offered exclusively through the **Accelerated B.S.–M.S. (AM)** pathway. Students complete integrated undergraduate and graduate training, culminating in an original master’s thesis.

Students work with their advisor and Thesis Guidance Committee to develop and complete an independent research project. The degree is awarded upon completion of required coursework, successful thesis research and defense, and approval of the thesis by the committee and Graduate School.

This program is designed to prepare students for:
- Ph.D. programs in biomedical and biological sciences  
- Health professional programs  
- Immediate entry into the scientific workforce  

Students are encouraged to present research at scientific conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Core Knowledge:** Demonstrate advanced understanding of neuroscience and behavior, with specialized expertise in a chosen focus area.  
- **Critical Thinking:** Formulate and test hypotheses through rigorous experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation.  
- **Research:** Conduct independent research including experimental design, data collection, analysis, and dissemination of results.  
- **Communication:** Effectively communicate scientific findings through written, oral, and visual formats including publications and presentations.  
- **Professionalism:** Develop leadership, teamwork, ethical, and interpersonal skills necessary for collaborative scientific careers.

## Program Requirements and Timeline

### Credit Requirements

This degree is available only through the **Accelerated Master’s (AM)** program. Students may apply up to **12 credits** of prior upper-level UNH coursework toward the M.S., consistent with AM policies. These credits may count toward both the B.S. and M.S. degrees but count as electives for the undergraduate major and do not replace core graduate requirements.

A minimum of **30 graduate credits** is required.

### Required Courses and Components

**Responsible Conduct of Research**
- Completion of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training (credit/fail)

**Scientific Communication**
- BIOL 950 – Scientific Communication (2 credits)

**Statistics**
- Two semesters of advanced statistics  
- At least one course must be at the 800–900 level  

**Research Techniques (1 course)**
Select one of the following:
- NSB 903  
- MCBS 901 – Introduction to Research in the Life Sciences  
- Other approved research techniques course  

**Graduate Seminar**
- Minimum of two semesters of graduate seminar  
- NSB 997 – Neuroscience and Behavior Graduate Seminar  
  (or equivalent approved seminar)

**Teaching Preparation**
- Required for all teaching assistants:  
  - GRAD 950 – Issues in College Teaching  

**Electives**
- Selected with advisor and committee based on specialization and career goals  

**Master’s Thesis**
- NSB 899 – Neuroscience and Behavior Master’s Thesis

## Research Proposal and Committee

### Thesis Guidance Committee

Students establish a Thesis Guidance Committee during the senior year or first semester of the graduate year. The committee typically includes:

- The advisor (chair)  
- At least three additional faculty members  
- Representation from at least two departments (e.g., Biological Sciences, MCBS, Psychology, Communication Sciences & Disorders)

Committee members, aside from the advisor, should not be directly involved in the student’s proposed research. Students must submit the Thesis Guidance Committee Nomination Form to the Graduate School.

The committee evaluates the feasibility, originality, and rigor of the research plan and approves coursework and research timelines.

### Research Proposal

The written proposal is typically modeled after an **NIH NRSA F31** fellowship format (or NSF/other agency format when appropriate). The proposal should describe a feasible research project using available resources and collaborations.

Typical proposal components:

**Specific Aims**
- One-page overview  
- Research gap and objectives  
- Two testable hypotheses  
- Potential impact  

**Research Strategy**
- **Background and Significance:** Context and importance of the research  
- **Innovation:** Conceptual or technical novelty  
- **Approach:** Methods, resources, anticipated challenges, and alternatives  
- **Timeline:** Major milestones and anticipated completion schedule  

The proposal is submitted during the first semester of the graduate year. Committee members may approve or request revisions. Once a majority approves the written proposal, the student proceeds with research.

## Thesis and Defense Timeline

Students meet with the Guidance Committee early in the graduate year to finalize thesis scope and timeline.

- Proposal approval: first semester of graduate year  
- Proposal defense (if required): typically Year 4 of combined program  
- Thesis defense: typically Year 5 of combined program  

The committee must determine readiness prior to scheduling the defense. The final thesis must be judged of publishable quality by the committee.

Students must meet all Graduate School requirements for thesis formatting, submission, and deadlines.

---

## Annual Progress Review

Each spring, students participate in an annual progress review with a representative of the Graduate Program Committee.

**Goals of the review:**
- Encourage reflection on progress and goals  
- Support timely degree completion  
- Provide mentorship and feedback  
- Maintain clear documentation of progress  

**Preparation includes:**
- Student progress report submitted to advisor and committee  
- Advisor evaluation and summary of committee meeting  
- Teaching feedback (if applicable)

All materials are submitted to the designated departmental staff member, who schedules review meetings (typically mid-April through mid-May). Failure to complete required materials may result in a registration hold.

## Completing the Degree

Students are responsible for understanding all program and Graduate School requirements, including:

- Coursework and credit requirements  
- Committee formation and required paperwork  
- Thesis formatting and submission requirements  
- Defense scheduling procedures and deadlines  

A public seminar and thesis defense are required. The thesis must be provided to the committee at least **two weeks** before the defense.

Final thesis submission must meet Graduate School deadlines and formatting requirements.
